  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) plays a pivotal role in reduction of uncertainties during both optimization and decision making processes. It can be applied to solve a variety of real-world applications in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two most widely-used UQ methods in the literature. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., self-driving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning. Moreover, we also investigate the application of these methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Then, we outline a few important applications of UQ methods. Finally, we briefly highlight the fundamental research challenges faced by UQ methods and discuss the future research directions in this field.},

  abstract = {We have conducted a detailed investigation of the broadband spectral properties of the γ-ray selected blazars of the Fermi LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS). By combining our accurately estimated Fermi γ-ray spectra with Swift, radio, infra-red, optical, and other hard X-ray/γ-ray data, collected within 3 months of the LBAS data taking period, we were able to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SED) for 48 LBAS blazars. The SED of these γ-ray sources is similar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, in the usual log ν-log ν F ν representation, the typical broadband spectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energy synchrotron radiation followed by inverse Compton emission of one or more components. We have used these SED to characterize the peak intensity of both the low- and the high-energy components. The results have been used to derive empirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from the broadband colors (i.e., the radio to optical, αro, and optical to X-ray, αox, spectral slopes) and from the γ-ray spectral index. Our data show that the synchrotron peak frequency (ν S peak) is positioned between 1012.5 and 1014.5 Hz in broad-lined flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and between 1013 and 1017 Hz in featureless BL Lacertae objects. We find that the γ-ray spectral slope is strongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the X-ray spectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron-inverse Compton scenarios. However, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models cannot explain most of our SED, especially in the case of FSRQs and low energy peaked (LBL) BL Lacs. More complex models involving external Compton radiation or multiple SSC components are required to reproduce the overall SED and the observed spectral variability. While more than 50\% of known radio bright high energy peaked (HBL) BL Lacs are detected in the LBAS sample, only less than 13\% of known bright FSRQs and LBL BL Lacs are included. This suggests that the latter sources, as a class, may be much fainter γ-ray emitters than LBAS blazars, and could in fact radiate close to the expectations of simple SSC models. We categorized all our sources according to a new physical classification scheme based on the generally accepted paradigm for Active Galactic Nuclei and on the results of this SED study. Since the LAT detector is more sensitive to flat spectrum γ-ray sources, the correlation between ν S peak and γ-ray spectral index strongly favors the detection of high energy peaked blazars, thus explaining the Fermi overabundance of this type of sources compared to radio and EGRET samples. This selection effect is similar to that experienced in the soft X-ray band where HBL BL Lacs are the dominant type of blazars.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art optimization is steadily shifting towards massively parallel pipelines with extremely large batch sizes. As a consequence, CPU-bound preprocessing and disk/memory/network operations have emerged as new performance bottlenecks, as opposed to hardware-accelerated gradient computations. In this regime, a recently proposed approach is data echoing (Choi et al., 2019), which takes repeated gradient steps on the same batch while waiting for fresh data to arrive from upstream. We provide the first convergence analyses of "data-echoed" extensions of common optimization methods, showing that they exhibit provable improvements over their synchronous counterparts. Specifically, we show that in convex optimization with stochastic minibatches, data echoing affords speedups on the curvature-dominated part of the convergence rate, while maintaining the optimal statistical rate.},

The physics processes offered cover a comprehensive range, including electromagnetic, hadronic and optical processes, a large set of long-lived particles, materials and elements, over a wide energy range starting, in some cases, from 250eV and extending in others to the TeV energy range. It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics.},

  abstract = {\textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterContext\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater. The BL Lac object S5 0716+714, a highly variable blazar, underwent an impressive outburst in January 2015 (Phase A), followed by minor activity in February (Phase B). The MAGIC observations were triggered by the optical flux observed in Phase A, corresponding to the brightest ever reported state of the source in the \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterR\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater-band.\textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterAims\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater.The comprehensive dataset collected is investigated in order to shed light on the mechanism of the broadband emission.\textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterMethods\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater. Multi-wavelength light curves have been studied together with the broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The sample includes data from Effelsberg, OVRO, Metsähovi, VLBI, CARMA, IRAM, SMA, \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterSwift\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater-UVOT, KVA, Tuorla, Steward, RINGO3, KANATA, AZT-8+ST7, Perkins, LX-200, \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterSwift\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater-XRT, \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterNuSTAR\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater, \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterFermi\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater-LAT and MAGIC.\textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterResults\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater. The flaring state of Phase A was detected in all the energy bands, providing for the first time a multi-wavelength sample of simultaneous data from the radio band to the very-high-energy (VHE, \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterE\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater \textbackslash textgreater 100 GeV). In the constructed SED, the \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterSwift\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater-XRT+\textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterNuSTAR\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater data constrain the transition between the synchrotron and inverse Compton components very accurately, while the second peak is constrained from 0.1 GeV to 600 GeV by \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterFermi\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater+MAGIC data. The broadband SED cannot be described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model as it severely underestimates the optical flux in order to reproduce the X-ray to \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterγ\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater-ray data. Instead we use a two-zone model. The electric vector position angle (EVPA) shows an unprecedented fast rotation. An estimation of the redshift of the source by combined high-energy (HE, 0.1 GeV \textbackslash textless \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterE\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater \textbackslash textless 100 GeV) and VHE data provides a value of \textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterz\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater = 0.31 ± 0.02\textbackslash textlesssub\textbackslash textgreaterstats\textbackslash textlesssub/\textbackslash textgreater ± 0.05\textbackslash textlesssub\textbackslash textgreatersys\textbackslash textlesssub/\textbackslash textgreater, confirming the literature value.\textbackslash textlessi\textbackslash textgreaterConclusions\textbackslash textlessi/\textbackslash textgreater. The data show the VHE emission originating in the entrance and exit of a superluminal knot in and out of a recollimation shock in the inner jet. A shock–shock interaction in the jet seems responsible for the observed flares and EVPA swing. This scenario is also consistent with the SED modeling.},

  abstract = {Contextual word embedding models such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) have dramatically improved performance for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks in recent months. However, these models have been minimally explored on specialty corpora, such as clinical text; moreover, in the clinical domain, no publicly-available pre-trained BERT models yet exist. In this work, we address this need by exploring and releasing BERT models for clinical text: one for generic clinical text and another for discharge summaries specifically. We demonstrate that using a domain-specific model yields performance improvements on three common clinical NLP tasks as compared to nonspecific embeddings. These domain-specific models are not as performant on two clinical de-identification tasks, and argue that this is a natural consequence of the differences between de-identified source text and synthetically non de-identified task text.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of pattern formation is studied for lateral-inhibition type homogeneous neural fields with general connections. Neural fields consisting of single layer are first treated, and it is proved that there are five types of pattern dynamics. The type of the dynamics of a field depends not only on the mutual connections within the field but on the level of homogeneous stimulus given to the field. An example of the dynamics is as follows: A fixed size of localized excitation, once evoked by stimulation, can be retained in the field persistently even after the stimulation vanishes. It moves until it finds the position of the maximum of the input stimulus. Fields consisting of an excitatory and an inhibitory layer are next analyzed. In addition to stationary localized excitation, fields have such pattern dynamics as production of oscillatory waves, travelling waves, active and dual active transients, etc.},

  abstract = {When a parameter space has a certain underlying structure, the ordinary gradient of a function does not represent its steepest direction, but the natural gradient does. Information geometry is used for calculating the natural gradients in the parameter space of perceptrons, the space of matrices (for blind source separation), and the space of linear dynamical systems (for blind source deconvolution). The dynamical behavior of natural gradient online learning is analyzed and is proved to be Fisher efficient, implying that it has asymptotically the same performance as the optimal batch estimation of parameters. This suggests that the plateau phenomenon, which appears in the backpropagation learning algorithm of multilayer perceptrons, might disappear or might not be so serious when the natural gradient is used. An adaptive method of updating the learning rate is proposed and analyzed.}

  abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel approach for layerwise representation learning of a trained neural network. In particular, we form a Bregman divergence based on the layer's transfer function and construct an extension of the original Bregman PCA formulation by incorporating a mean vector and normalizing the principal directions with respect to the geometry of the local convex function around the mean. This generalization allows exporting the learned representation as a fixed layer with a non-linearity. As an application to knowledge distillation, we cast the learning problem for the student network as predicting the compression coefficients of the teacher's representations, which are passed as the input to the imported layer. Our empirical findings indicate that our approach is substantially more effective for transferring information between networks than typical teacher-student training using the teacher's penultimate layer representations and soft labels.},

We conduct ablations across multiple architectures of varying sizes as well as initializations and activation functions. Our analysis suggests that certain structures that manifest in a trained model are already present at initialization.

Nonetheless, their large memory requirement and high computational complexity, compared to first-order methods, hinder their versatility in a typical low-budget setup. This paper introduces a general framework of layerwise loss construction for multilayer neural networks that achieves a performance closer to second-order methods while utilizing first-order optimizers only. Our methodology lies upon a three-component loss, target, and regularizer combination, for which altering each component results in a new update rule. We provide examples using squared loss and layerwise Bregman divergences induced by the convex integral functions of various transfer functions. Our experiments on benchmark models and datasets validate the efficacy of our new approach, reducing the gap between first-order and second-order optimizers.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the problem of using in-distribution public data to improve the privacy/utility trade-offs for differentially private (DP) model training. (Here, public data refers to auxiliary data sets that have no privacy concerns.) We design a natural variant of DP mirror descent, where the DP gradients of the private/sensitive data act as the linear term, and the loss generated by the public data as the mirror map. We show that, for linear regression with feature vectors drawn from a non-isotropic sub-Gaussian distribution, our algorithm, PDA-DPMD (a variant of mirror descent), provides population risk guarantees that are asymptotically better than the best known guarantees under DP (without having access to public data), when the number of public data samples (\$n\_\{\textbackslash sf pub\}\$) is sufficiently large. We further show that our algorithm has natural "noise stability" properties that control the variance due to noise added to ensure DP. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by showing privacy/utility trade-offs on four benchmark datasets (StackOverflow, WikiText-2, CIFAR-10, and EMNIST). We show that our algorithm not only significantly improves over traditional DP-SGD, which does not have access to public data, but to our knowledge is the first to improve over DP-SGD on models that have been pre-trained with public data.},

Similarly, the logarithm in the loss we use for training is replaced by a low-temperature logarithm. By tuning the two temperatures, we create loss functions that are non-convex already in the single layer case. When replacing the last layer of the neural networks by our bi-temperature generalization of the logistic loss, the training becomes more robust to noise. We visualize the effect of tuning the two temperatures in a simple setting and show the efficacy of our method on large datasets. Our methodology is based on Bregman divergences and is superior to a related two-temperature method that uses the Tsallis divergence.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

  abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

  abstract = {We present average R-band optopolarimetric data, as well as variability parameters, from the first and second RoboPol observing season. We investigate whether gamma- ray--loud and gamma-ray--quiet blazars exhibit systematic differences in their optical polarization properties. We find that gamma-ray--loud blazars have a systematically higher polarization fraction (0.092) than gamma-ray--quiet blazars (0.031), with the hypothesis of the two samples being drawn from the same distribution of polarization fractions being rejected at the 3 sigma level. We have not found any evidence that this discrepancy is related to differences in the redshift distribution, rest-frame R-band lu- minosity density, or the source classification. The median polarization fraction versus synchrotron-peak-frequency plot shows an envelope implying that high synchrotron- peaked sources have a smaller range of median polarization fractions concentrated around lower values. Our gamma-ray--quiet sources show similar median polarization fractions although they are all low synchrotron-peaked. We also find that the random- ness of the polarization angle depends on the synchrotron peak frequency. For high synchrotron-peaked sources it tends to concentrate around preferred directions while for low synchrotron-peaked sources it is more variable and less likely to have a pre- ferred direction. We propose a scenario which mediates efficient particle acceleration in shocks and increases the helical B-field component immediately downstream of the shock.},

Second-order optimization methods, that involve second derivatives and/or second order statistics of the data, are far less prevalent despite strong theoretical properties, due to their prohibitive computation, memory and communication costs. In an attempt to bridge this gap between theoretical and practical optimization, we present a scalable implementation of a second-order preconditioned method (concretely, a variant of full-matrix Adagrad), that along with several critical algorithmic and numerical improvements, provides significant convergence and wall-clock time improvements compared to conventional first-order methods on state-of-the-art deep models. Our novel design effectively utilizes the prevalent heterogeneous hardware architecture for training deep models, consisting of a multicore CPU coupled with multiple accelerator units. We demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art on very large learning tasks such as machine translation with Transformers, language modeling with BERT, click-through rate prediction on Criteo, and image classification on ImageNet with ResNet-50.},

By exploiting the sequential structure of feed-forward networks, we are able to both evaluate our training objective and make predictions with a single forward pass.

Specifically, we use a change of variables to connect our prior beliefs on the image TV semi-norm with the hyper-parameters of the DIP network. For the inference, we develop an approach based on the linearised Laplace method, which is scalable to high-dimensional settings. The resulting framework provides pixel-wise uncertainty estimates and a marginal likelihood objective for hyperparameter optimisation. We demonstrate the method on synthetic and real-measured high-resolution \$\textbackslash mu\$CT data, and show that it provides superior calibration of uncertainty estimates relative to previous probabilistic formulations of the DIP.},

This paper suggests that, sometimes, increasing depth can speed up optimization. The effect of depth on optimization is decoupled from expressiveness by focusing on settings where additional layers amount to overparameterization – linear neural networks, a well-studied model. Theoretical analysis, as well as experiments, show that here depth acts as a preconditioner which may accelerate convergence. Even on simple convex problems such as linear regression with ℓ𝑝ℓp\textbackslash ell\_p loss, 𝑝{$>$}2p{$>$}2p{$>$}2, gradient descent can benefit from transitioning to a non-convex overparameterized objective, more than it would from some common acceleration schemes. We also prove that it is mathematically impossible to obtain the acceleration effect of overparametrization via gradients of any regularizer.},

We demonstrate that this can indeed happen due to a phenomenon we term silent alignment, which requires that the tangent kernel of a network evolves in eigenstructure while small and before the loss appreciably decreases, and grows only in overall scale afterwards. We show that such an effect takes place in homogenous neural networks with small initialization and whitened data. We provide an analytical treatment of this effect in the linear network case. In general, we find that the kernel develops a low-rank contribution in the early phase of training, and then evolves in overall scale, yielding a function equivalent to a kernel regression solution with the final network's tangent kernel. The early spectral learning of the kernel depends on the depth. We also demonstrate that non-whitened data can weaken the silent alignment effect.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

The core simulation capabilities are complemented by a full suite of post-processing applications which support the spatial, spectral, and temporal models needed for analysis of typical polarized X-ray sources, allowing for the implementation of complex, polarization-aware analysis pipelines, and facilitating the interoperation with the standard visualization and analysis tools traditionally in use by the X-ray community.

The very compact design and the absence of the gas flow system make this detector substantially ready for use as focal plane detector for future X-ray space telescopes. The instrument brings high sensitivity to X-ray polarimetry, which is the last unexplored field of X-ray astronomy. It derives the polarization information from the track of the photoelectrons that are imaged by a high-gain ({$>$}1000), fine pitch GEM that matches the pitch of a pixel ASIC which is the collecting anode of the GPD (105k, 50 μm wide, hexagonal cells). The device is able to simultaneously perform good imaging (50 60 μm), moderate spectroscopy (∼15\% at 6 keV) as well as fast, high-rate timing in the 1 10 keV range. Moreover, being truly 2D, it is non-dispersive and does not require any rotation. The great improvement of sensitivity, at least two orders of magnitude with respect to traditional polarimeters (based on Bragg crystals or Thomson scattering), will allow the direct exploration of the most dramatic objects of the X-ray sky. At the focus of the large mirror area of the XEUS telescope it will be decisive in reaching many of the scientific goals of the mission. With integration times of the order of 1 day, polarimetry of Active Galactic Nuclei at the percent level will be possible, making for a real breakthrough in high-energy astrophysics.},

  abstract = {The role of intrinsic cortical connections in processing sensory input and in generating behavioral output is poorly understood. We have examined this issue in the context of the tuning of neuronal responses in cortex to the orientation of a visual stimulus. We analytically study a simple network model that incorporates both orientation-selective input from the lateral geniculate nucleus and orientation-specific cortical interactions. Depending on the model parameters, the network exhibits orientation selectivity that originates from within the cortex, by a symmetry-breaking mechanism. In this case, the width of the orientation tuning can be sharp even if the lateral geniculate nucleus inputs are only weakly anisotropic. By using our model, several experimental consequences of this cortical mechanism of orientation tuning are derived. The tuning width is relatively independent of the contrast and angular anisotropy of the visual stimulus. The transient population response to changing of the stimulus orientation exhibits a slow "virtual rotation." Neuronal cross-correlations exhibit long time tails, the sign of which depends on the preferred orientations of the cells and the stimulus orientation.},

We investigated the spectral shapes of the sources using single power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabola models. We also studied the co-relation between the soft and hard emission using z-transformed discrete correlation function. In addition, we attempted to constrain the smallest emission regions using minimum variability timescales derived from the light curves.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. We found that, for most of the sources, the hard X-ray emission can be well represented by the log-parabola model and that the spectral slopes for different blazar subclasses are consistent with the so-called blazar sequence. We also report the steepest spectra (Γ ∼ 3) in the BL Lacertae PKS 2155–304 and the hardest spectra (Γ ∼ 1.4) in the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 2149–306. In addition, we noted a close connection between the flux and spectral slope within the source subclass in the sense that high flux and/or flux states tend to be harder in spectra. In BL Lacertae objects, assuming particle acceleration by diffusive shocks and synchrotron cooling as the dominant processes governing the observed flux variability, we constrain the magnetic field of the emission region to be a few Gauss; whereas in flat-spectrum radio quasars, using external Compton models, we estimate the energy of the lower end of the injected electrons to be a few Lorentz factors.}}}}}},

  abstract = {Here we report on the results of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope photo-polarimetric campaign targeting the blazar S5 0716+71, organized in 2014 March to monitor the source simultaneously in BVRI and near-IR filters. The campaign resulted in an unprecedented data set spanning ∼110 hr of nearly continuous, multiband observations, including two sets of densely sampled polarimetric data mainly in the R filter. During the campaign, the source displayed pronounced variability with peak-to-peak variations of about 30\% and “bluer-when-brighter” spectral evolution, consisting of a day-timescale modulation with superimposed hour-long microflares characterized by ∼0.1 mag flux changes. We performed an in-depth search for quasi-periodicities in the source light curve; hints for the presence of oscillations on timescales of ∼3 and ∼5 hr do not represent highly significant departures from a pure red-noise power spectrum. We observed that, at a certain configuration of the optical polarization angle (PA) relative to the PA of the innermost radio jet in the source, changes in the polarization degree (PD) led the total flux variability by about 2 hr; meanwhile, when the relative configuration of the polarization and jet angles altered, no such lag could be noted. The microflaring events, when analyzed as separate pulse emission components, were found to be characterized by a very high PD ({$>$}30\%) and PAs that differed substantially from the PA of the underlying background component, or from the radio jet positional angle. We discuss the results in the general context of blazar emission and energy dissipation models. ).},

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field. The present concepts are applied to a model of an active galactic nucleus containing a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk.},

An idealized description of the steady radio emission from a relativistic jet is presented, the variable component of the emission is associated with shock waves traveling in the jet, and the dynamical and radiative properties of accelerated clouds and of velocity disturbances that steepen to form propagating shocks are examined. It is shown that several observed features of compact radio sources can be interpreted on the assumption that these sources are relativistic jets viewed at small angles to their axes.

A possible connection of polarization swing events with periods of high activity in gamma-rays is investigated using the data set obtained during the first season of operation. It was found that the brightest gamma-ray flares tend to be located closer in time to rotation events, which may be an indication of two separate mechanisms responsible for the rotations. Blazars with detected rotations during non-rotating periods have significantly larger amplitude and faster variations of polarization angle than blazars without rotations. Our simulations show that the full set of observed rotations is not a likely outcome (probability ≤1.5 × 10-2) of a random walk of the polarization vector simulated by a multicell model. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely (˜5 × 10-5) that none of our rotations is physically connected with an increase in gamma-ray activity.},

This variation cannot be explained either by a difference in the relativistic boosting or by selection effects caused by a difference in the average fractional polarization.

We investigate patterns of variability in the polarization parameters and total flux density during the rotation events and compare them to the behaviour in a non-rotating state. We have searched for possible correlations between average parameters of the polarization-plane rotations and average parameters of polarization, with the following results: (1) there is no statistical association of the rotations with contemporaneous optical flares; (2) the average fractional polarization during the rotations tends to be lower than that in a non-rotating state; (3) the average fractional polarization during rotations is correlated with the rotation rate of the polarization plane in the jet rest frame; (4) it is likely that distributions of amplitudes and durations of the rotations have physical upper bounds, so arbitrarily long rotations are not realized in nature.},

We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

The power-law dependence is found to remain the same as in the case of zero synchrotron loss up to a critical energy level, above which exponential cutoff is observed, and the critical energy is shown to decrease with the downstream distance from the shock. Numerical results are presented graphically, and the size of the synchrotron-emission region in the low-frequency strong-shock limit for a spatially resolved shock region is shown to increase with decreasing frequency with a power-law index of -0.5, as observed in knot A of the M87 jet (Owen et al., 1980); for unresolved objects, slopes of about -1.0 (with steepening at high frequencies) are predicted, consistent with observations of quasars and BL Lac objects.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.}

To maximize IACT sensitivity, gamma-ray showers must be efficiently distinguished from the dominant background of cosmic-ray showers using images from multiple telescopes. A combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) has been proposed to perform this task. Using CTLearn, an open source Python package using deep learning to analyze data from IACTs, with simulated data from the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), we implement a CNN-RNN network and find no evidence that sorting telescope images by total amplitude improves background rejection performance.},

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a widely studied NLP task where the goal is to determine opinions, emotions, and evaluations of users towards a product, an entity or a service that they are reviewing. One of the biggest challenges for sentiment analysis is that it is highly language dependent. Word embeddings, sentiment lexicons, and even annotated data are language specific. Further, optimizing models for each language is very time consuming and labor intensive especially for recurrent neural network models. From a resource perspective, it is very challenging to collect data for different languages. In this paper, we look for an answer to the following research question: can a sentiment analysis model trained on a language be reused for sentiment analysis in other languages, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, and Dutch, where the data is more limited? Our goal is to build a single model in the language with the largest dataset available for the task, and reuse it for languages that have limited resources. For this purpose, we train a sentiment analysis model using recurrent neural networks with reviews in English. We then translate reviews in other languages and reuse this model to evaluate the sentiments. Experimental results show that our robust approach of single model trained on English reviews statistically significantly outperforms the baselines in several different languages.},

  abstract = {In this paper, spectral energy distributions (SED) of both synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) components of a sample of Fermi bright blazars are fitted by a log-parabolic law. The second-degree term of the log parabola measures the curvature of an SED. We find a statistically significant correlation between the synchrotron peak frequency and its curvature. This result is in agreement with the theoretical prediction and confirms previous studies that dealt with a single source with observations at various epochs or a small sample. If a broken power law is employed to fit the SED, the difference between the two spectral indices (i.e., \textbackslash textbarα2 - α1\textbackslash textbar) can be considered a "surrogate" of the SED curvature. We collect data from the literature and find a correlation between the synchrotron peak frequency and the spectral difference. We do not find a significant correlation between the IC peak frequency and its curvature, which may be caused by a complicated seed photon field. It is also found that the synchrotron curvatures are on average larger than those of IC curvatures, and there is no correlation between these two parameters. As suggested by previous works, both the log-parabolic law of the SED and the above correlation can be explained by statistical and/or stochastic particle accelerations. Based on a comparison of the slops of the correlation, our result seems to favor stochastic acceleration mechanisms and emission processes. Additional evidence, including SED modeling, particle acceleration simulation, and comparisons between some predictions and empirical relations/correlations, also seems to support the idea that the electron energy distribution (and/or synchrotron SED) may be log-parabolic.},

  abstract = {We report that active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets are causally connected on parsec scales, based on 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data from a sample of 133 AGN jets. This result is achieved through a new method for measuring the product of the jet Lorentz factor and the intrinsic opening angle Γ\emph{θ{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{j{$<$}sub/{$>$} from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited samples of AGN jets. The Γ\emph{θ{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{j{$<$}sub/{$>$} parameter is important for jet physics because it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal connection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most importantly, the standard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected with its symmetry axis, implying that Γ\emph{θ{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{j{$<$}sub/{$>$} ≲ 1. When we apply our method to the MOJAVE flux density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find Γ\emph{θ{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{j{$<$}sub/{$>$} ≈ 0.2, implying that AGN jets are causally connected. We also find evidence that AGN jets viewed very close to the line of sight effectively have smaller intrinsic opening angles compared with jets viewed more off-axis, which is consistent with Doppler beaming and a fast inner spine/slow outer sheath velocity field. Notably, gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets have a typical Γ\emph{θ{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{j{$<$}sub/{$>$} that is two orders of magnitude higher, suggesting that different physical mechanisms are at work in GRB jets compared to AGN jets. A useful application of our result is that a jet’s beaming parameters can be derived. Assuming Γ\emph{θ{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{j{$<$}sub/{$>$} is approximately constant in the AGN jet population, an individual jet’s Doppler factor and Lorentz factor (and therefore also its viewing angle) can be determined using two observable quantities: apparent jet opening angle and the apparent speed of jet components.}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Using the squared error loss function, a closed form of the minimum risk equivariant (MRE) estimator is derived. While several properties of the estimator are discussed, this article focuses particularly on the efficiency of the MRE (or the Pitman) estimator in finite samples. A simulation study indicates that the gain in efficiency when using the MRE estimator rather than the MLE is particularly important in small samples. We also compare the performance of the Pitman estimator with that of other equivariant estimators, including M- and L-estimators and some approximations to the Pitman estimator. In addition, we study the unconditional and conditional inference of the Cauchy location parameter based on both the MLE and the Pitman estimator. We further assess the small sample robustness properties of the estimators included in the simulation by contaminating the Cauchy distribution at three different levels of contamination.},

The data display rotation reversals in which the EVPA rotates counterclockwise for ∼180° and then rotates clockwise by a similar amount. The timescale of the rotations is a few weeks to a year, and the scale for a double rotation, including the reversal, is 1–3 yr. We have seen four of these events in 40 yr. A model consisting of two successive outbursts in polarized flux density, with EVPAs counterrotating, superposed on a steady polarized jet, can explain many of the details of the observations. Polarization images support this interpretation. The model can also help to explain similar events seen at optical wavelengths. The outbursts needed for the model can be generated by the supermagnetosonic jet model of Nakamura et al. and Nakamura \& Meier, which requires a strong helical magnetic field. This model produces forward and reverse pairs of fast and slow MHD waves, and the plasma inside the two fast/slow pairs rotates around the jet axis, but in opposite directions.},

We have obtained 1.4 GHz VLA A configuration data on 57 of these sources to investigate whether the extended luminosity of blazars is correlated with parsec-scale jet speed and also to determine what other parsec-scale properties are related to extended morphology, such as optical emission line strength and gamma-ray emission.

  abstract = {The study of astronomical objects using electromagnetic radiation  involves four basic observational approaches: imaging, spectroscopy, photometry (accurate counting of the photons received) and polarimetry (measurement of the polarizations of the observed photons). In contrast to observations at other wavelengths, a lack of sensitivity has prevented X-ray astronomy from making use of polarimetry. Yet such a technique could provide a direct picture of the state of matter in extreme magnetic and gravitational fields, and has the potential to resolve the internal structures of compact sources that would otherwise remain inaccessible, even to X-ray interferometry. In binary pulsars, for example, we could directly `see' the rotation of the magnetic field and determine if the emission is in the form of a `fan' or a `pencil' beam. Also, observation of the characteristic twisting of the polarization angle in other compact sources would reveal the presence of a black hole. Here we report the development of an instrument that makes X-ray polarimetry possible. The factor of 100 improvement in sensitivity that we have achieved will allow direct exploration of the most dramatic objects of the X-ray sky.},

  abstract = {Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have revealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates, including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies. Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.},

  abstract = {The BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714 is one of the most studied blazars on the sky due to its active variability and brightness in many bands, including very-high-energy gamma rays. We present here two serendipitous results from recent far-ultraviolet spectroscopic observations by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). First, during the course of our 7.3 hr HST observations, the blazar increased in flux rapidly by ∼40\% (−0.45 mag hr−1) followed by a slower decline (+0.36 mag hr−1) to previous FUV flux levels. We model this flare using asymmetric flare templates and constrain the physical size and energetics of the emitting region. Furthermore, the spectral index of the object softens considerably during the course of the flare from αν ≈ −1.0 to αν ≈ −1.4. Second, we constrain the source redshift directly using the ∼30 intervening absorption systems. A system at z = 0.2315 is detected in Lyα, Lyβ, O vi, and N v and defines the lower bound on the source redshift. No absorbers are seen in the remaining spectral coverage (0.2315 {$<$} zLyα ≲ 0.47) and we set a statistical upper bound of z {$<$} 0.322 (95\% confidence) on the blazar. This is the first direct redshift limit for this object and is consistent with literature estimates of z = 0.31 ± 0.08 based on the detection of a host galaxy.},

  abstract = {In state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training produces semantically good representations by encouraging them to be invariant under meaningful transformations prescribed from human knowledge. In fact, the property of invariance is a trivial instance of a broader class called equivariance, which can be intuitively understood as the property that representations transform according to the way the inputs transform. Here, we show that rather than using only invariance, pre-training that encourages non-trivial equivariance to some transformations, while maintaining invariance to other transformations, can be used to improve the semantic quality of representations. Specifically, we extend popular SSL methods to a more general framework which we name Equivariant Self-Supervised Learning (E-SSL). In E-SSL, a simple additional pre-training objective encourages equivariance by predicting the transformations applied to the input. We demonstrate E-SSL's effectiveness empirically on several popular computer vision benchmarks, e.g. improving SimCLR to 72.5\% linear probe accuracy on ImageNet. Furthermore, we demonstrate usefulness of E-SSL for applications beyond computer vision; in particular, we show its utility on regression problems in photonics science. Our code, datasets and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/rdangovs/essl to aid further research in E-SSL.},

  abstract = {We explore the variability and cross-frequency correlation of the flux density and polarization of the blazar OJ287, using imaging at 43 GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array, as well as optical and near-infrared (near-IR) polarimetry. The polarization and flux density in both the optical waveband and the 43 GHz compact core increased by a small amount in late 2005, and increased significantly along with the near-IR polarization and flux density over the course of 10 days in early 2006. Furthermore, the values of the electric vector position angle (EVPA) at the three wavebands are similar. At 43 GHz, the EVPA of the blazar core is perpendicular to the flow of the jet, while the EVPAs of emerging superluminal knots are aligned parallel to the jet axis. The core polarization is that expected if shear aligns the magnetic field at the boundary between flows of disparate velocities within the jet. Using variations in flux density, percentage polarization, and EVPA, we model the inner jet as a spine-sheath system. The model jet contains a turbulent spine of half-width 1 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/fdg.gif] fdg 2 and maximum Lorentz factor of 16.5, a turbulent sheath with Lorentz factor of 5, and a boundary region of sheared field between the spine and sheath. Transverse shocks propagating along the fast, turbulent spine can explain the superluminal knots. The observed flux density and polarization variations are then compatible with changes in the direction of the inner jet caused by a temporary change in the position of the core if the spine contains wiggles owing to an instability. In addition, we can explain a stable offset of optical and near-IR percentage polarization by a steepening of spectral index with frequency, as supported by the data.},

  abstract = {The jet composition and energy dissipation mechanism of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and Blazars are fundamental questions which remain not fully understood. One plausible model is to interpret the \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray emission of GRBs and optical emission of blazars as synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated from the collision-induced magnetic dissipation regions in Poynting-flux-dominated jets. The polarization observation is an important and independent information to test this model. Based on our recent 3D relativistic MHD simulations of collision-induced magnetic dissipation of magnetically dominated blobs, here we perform calculations of the polarization properties of the emission in the dissipation region and apply the results to model the polarization observational data of GRB prompt emission and blazar optical emission. We show that the same numerical model with different input parameters can reproduce well the observational data of both GRBs and blazars, especially the \$90\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ polarization angle (PA) change in GRB 100826A and the \$180\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ PA swing in Blazar 3C279. This supports a unified model for GRB and blazar jets, suggesting that collision-induced magnetic reconnection is a common physical mechanism to power the relativistic jet emission from events with very different black hole masses.},

  abstract = {The X-ray polarization properties of the reflection nebulae in the Galactic center inform us about the direction of the illuminating source (through the polarization angle) and the cloud position along the line of sight (through the polarization degree). However, the detected polarization degree is expected to be lowered because the polarized emission of the clouds is mixed with the unpolarized diffuse emission that permeates the Galactic center region. In a real observation, also the morphological smearing of the source due to the point spread function and the unpolarized instrumental background contribute in diluting the polarization degree. So far, these effects have never been included in the estimation of the dilution. We evaluate the detectability of the X-ray polarization predicted for the MC2, Bridge-B2, G0.11-0.11, Sgr B2, Sgr C1, Sgr C2, and Sgr C3 molecular clouds with modern X-ray imaging polarimeters such as the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), which is expected to launch in 2021, and the Enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission (eXTP), whose launch is scheduled for 2027. We perform realistic simulations of X-ray polarimetric observations considering (with the aid of Chandra maps and spectra) the spatial, spectral, and polarization properties of all the diffuse emission and background components in each region of interest. We find that in the 4.0-8.0 keV band, where the emission of the molecular clouds outshines the other components, the dilution of the polarization degree, including the contribution due to the morphological smearing of the source, ranges between \textasciitilde 19\% and \textasciitilde 55\%. We conclude that for some distance values reported in the literature, the diluted polarization degree of G0.11-0.11, Sgr B2, Bridge-B2, Bridge-E, Sgr C1, and Sgr C3 may be detectable in a 2 Ms long IXPE observations. With the same exposure time, and considering the whole range of possible distances reported in the literature, the enhanced capabilities of eXTP may allow detecting the 4.0-8.0 keV of all the targets considered here.},

We use the Monte Carlo tool ixpeobssim to create realistic IXPE data products. We create simulated light-curves of polarization degree and angle by time-slicing the simulated data into arbitrary short time bins. We use a \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ test to assess the performance of the observations in detecting the time variability of the polarization properties. A series of 10 ks long observations permits IXPE to follow the time variability of the polarization degree in the case of the shock acceleration model. In the case of the magnetic reconnection model, the nominal injected model provides the best fit of the simulated IXPE data for time bins of 5-10 ks, depending on the tested flux level. For the TEMZ model, shorter time slices of 0.5 ks are needed for obtaining a formally good fit of the simulated IXPE data with the injected model. On the other hand, we find that a fit with a constant model provides a \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ lower than the fit with the nominal injected model when using time slices of 20 ks, 60/70 ks, and 5 ks for the case of the shock acceleration, magnetic reconnection and TEMZ model, respectively. We conclude that, provided that the statistics of the observation allows slicing of the data in adequately short time bins, IXPE observations of an HSP blazar at a typical flux level can detect the time variability predicted by popular models for particle acceleration in jets.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

  abstract = {Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performances but are typically over-parameterized. The over-parameterization may result in undesirably large generalization error in the absence of other customized training strategies. Recently, a line of research under the name of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has shown that minimizing a sharpness measure, which reflects the geometry of the loss landscape, can significantly reduce the generalization error. However, SAM-like methods incur a two-fold computational overhead of the given base optimizer (e.g. SGD) for approximating the sharpness measure. In this paper, we propose Sharpness-Aware Training for Free, or SAF, which mitigates the sharp landscape at almost zero additional computational cost over the base optimizer. Intuitively, SAF achieves this by avoiding sudden drops in the loss in the sharp local minima throughout the trajectory of the updates of the weights. Specifically, we suggest a novel trajectory loss, based on the KL-divergence between the outputs of DNNs with the current weights and past weights, as a replacement of the SAM's sharpness measure. This loss captures the rate of change of the training loss along the model's update trajectory. By minimizing it, SAF ensures the convergence to a flat minimum with improved generalization capabilities. Extensive empirical results show that SAF minimizes the sharpness in the same way that SAM does, yielding better results on the ImageNet dataset with essentially the same computational cost as the base optimizer.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

The accuracy and economy of the MultiNest algorithm is demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focussing on the extension of the vanilla \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MultiNest software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to CosmoMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SuperBayeS package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org},

  abstract = {I study the location of the γ -ray emission in blazar jets by creating a Compton-scattering approximation that is valid for all anisotropic radiation fields in the Thomson through Klein–Nishina regimes, is highly accurate, and can speed up numerical calculations by up to a factor of ∼10. I apply this approximation to synchrotron self-Compton, external Compton scattering of photons from the accretion disk, broad line region (BLR), and dust torus. I use a stratified BLR model and include detailed Compton-scattering calculations of a spherical and flattened BLR. I create two dust torus models, one where the torus is an annulus and one where it is an extended disk. I present detailed calculations of the photoabsorption optical depth using my detailed BLR and dust torus models, including the full angle dependence. I apply these calculations to the emission from a relativistically moving blob traveling through these radiation fields. The ratio of γ -ray to optical flux produces a predictable pattern that could help locate the γ -ray emission region. I show that the bright flare from 3C 454.3 in 2010 November detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope is unlikely to originate from a single blob inside the BLR. This is because it moves outside the BLR in a time shorter than the flare duration, although emission by multiple blobs inside the BLR is possible. Also, γ -rays are unlikely to originate from outside of the BLR, due to the scattering of photons from an extended dust torus, since the cooling timescale would be too long to explain the observed short variability.},

  abstract = {Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable approximate Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. We demonstrate that while low-loss connectors between modes exist, they are not connected in the space of predictions. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods.},

  abstract = {Evidence has been mounting that many of the transverse jet B fields observed in BL Lac objects on parsec scales represent the dominant toroidal component of the intrinsic jet B fields. Such fields could come about, for example, as a result of the ‘winding up’ of an initial ‘seed’ field with a significant longitudinal component by the rotation of the central accreting object. If this is the case, this should give rise to gradients in the rotation measure across the jets, due to the systematic change in the line-of-sight component of the jet B field. We present evidence for transverse rotation measure gradients in four BL Lac objects, strengthening arguments that the jets of these objects do indeed have toroidal or helical B fields. This underlines the view of the jets as fundamentally electromagnetic structures, and suggests that they may well carry non-zero currents. It also provides a natural means to collimate the jets.},

To this end, we devise a novel model component, named factored LSTM, which automatically distills the style factors in the monolingual text corpus. Then at runtime, we can explicitly control the style in the caption generation process so as to produce attractive visual captions with the desired style. Our approach achieves this goal by leveraging two sets of data: 1) factual image/video-caption paired data, and 2) stylized monolingual text data (e.g., romantic and humorous sentences). We show experimentally that StyleNet outperforms existing approaches for generating visual captions with different styles, measured in both automatic and human evaluation metrics on the newly collected FlickrStyle10K image caption dataset, which contains 10K Flickr images with corresponding humorous and romantic captions.},

This fast variability can be accounted for if the emitting region is moving with a bulk Lorentz factor Gamma\textasciitilde 50 and a similar relativistic Doppler factor. If this Gamma is adopted, several models can fit the data, but, irrespective of the chosen model, the jet is matter dominated. The Doppler factor requires viewing angles of the order of 1 degree or less: if the entire jet is as narrow as this, then we have problems with current unification schemes. This suggests that there are small active regions, inside a larger jet, moving faster than the rest of the plasma, occasionally pointing at us. Coordinated X-ray/TeV variability can discriminate between the different scenarios.},

  abstract = {In this work, we study the evolution of the loss Hessian across many classification tasks in order to understand the effect the curvature of the loss has on the training dynamics. Whereas prior work has focused on how different learning rates affect the loss Hessian observed during training, we also analyze the effects of model initialization, architectural choices, and common training heuristics such as gradient clipping and learning rate warmup. Our results demonstrate that successful model and hyperparameter choices allow the early optimization trajectory to either avoid -- or navigate out of -- regions of high curvature and into flatter regions that tolerate a higher learning rate. Our results suggest a unifying perspective on how disparate mitigation strategies for training instability ultimately address the same underlying failure mode of neural network optimization, namely poor conditioning. Inspired by the conditioning perspective, we show that learning rate warmup can improve training stability just as much as batch normalization, layer normalization, MetaInit, GradInit, and Fixup initialization.},

  abstract = {Many generative models can be expressed as a differentiable function of random inputs drawn from some simple probability density. This framework includes both deep generative architectures such as Variational Autoencoders and a large class of procedurally defined simulator models. We present a method for performing efficient MCMC inference in such models when conditioning on observations of the model output. For some models this offers an asymptotically exact inference method where Approximate Bayesian Computation might otherwise be employed. We use the intuition that inference corresponds to integrating a density across the manifold corresponding to the set of inputs consistent with the observed outputs. This motivates the use of a constrained variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo which leverages the smooth geometry of the manifold to coherently move between inputs exactly consistent with observations. We validate the method by performing inference tasks in a diverse set of models.},

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their outputs into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label unsegmented sequences directly, thereby solving both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its advantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

  abstract = {Preconditioned gradient methods are among the most general and powerful tools in optimization. However, preconditioning requires storing and manipulating prohibitively large matrices. We describe and analyze a new structure-aware preconditioning algorithm, called Shampoo, for stochastic optimization over tensor spaces. Shampoo maintains a set of preconditioning matrices, each of which operates on a single dimension, contracting over the remaining dimensions. We establish convergence guarantees in the stochastic convex setting, the proof of which builds upon matrix trace inequalities. Our experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models show that Shampoo is capable of converging considerably faster than commonly used optimizers. Surprisingly, although it involves a more complex update rule, Shampoo’s runtime per step is comparable in practice to that of simple gradient methods such as SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Both algorithms are easily generalized to larger neural networks, and the generalization of gradient descent is the standard backpropagation algorithm. We prove worst-case loss bounds for both algorithms in the single neuron case. Since local minima make it difficult to prove worst case bounds for gradient-based algorithms, we must use a loss function that prevents the formation of spurious local minima. We define such a matching loss function for any strictly increasing differentiable transfer function and prove worst-case loss bounds for any such transfer function and its corresponding matching loss. The different forms of the two algorithms' bounds indicates that exponentiated gradient outperforms gradient descent when the inputs contain a large number of irrelevant components. Simulations on synthetic data confirm these analytical results.},

While the approach was originally proposed as an non-Bayesian technique, arguments towards its Bayesian footing have been put forward as well. We show that deep ensembles can be viewed as an approximate Bayesian method by specifying the corresponding assumptions. Our finding leads to an improved approximation which results in an increased epistemic part of the uncertainty. Numerical examples suggest that the improved approximation can lead to more reliable uncertainties. Analytical derivations ensure easy calculation of results.},

In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

First, under what circumstances will learned models be optimizers, including when they should not be? Second, when a learned model is an optimizer, what will its objective be - how will it differ from the loss function it was trained under - and how can it be aligned? In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of these two primary questions and provide an overview of topics for future research.},

We then describe the construction of a computer code that utilizes these theories to study the properties of the radiation from shocked, parsec-scale extragalactic jets. Runs of this code with "example" shock patterns show that both the appearance of superluminal VLBI sources and the characteristics of the total and polarized flux evolution of variable compact sources may be understood in terms of one shock, or a sequence of closely spaced shocks, propagating along a diverging flow. We argue that multiple-shock events may be a common feature of such sources. The interpretation of VLBI maps is discussed. We note that, in this model, the "core-knot" separation is frequency-dependent, the knot may sometimes be brighter than the core, and, because of the multiplicity of components, infrequent mapping can lead to apparent contractions and accelerations.},

We estimate that the magnetic field in the radio-emitting region is significantly below its energy equipartition value, and that the plasma is a high-pressure, freely expanding flow with a mechanical luminosity comparable to the bolometric luminosities of the most active AGNs.},

Outbursts are due to shocks that locally compress the field, allowing for a significant degree of polarized emission from the shocked parts of the flow. It is demonstrated that short time scale activity evident in the polarized flux is compatible with the contemporaneous, long time scale, apparently single outbursts in the total flux. This effect arises in part because high opacity restricts the duration of the polarized outbursts, keeping them distinct and in part because of the cancellation between orthogonal polarizations associated with the axial and the commpressed, tangled magnetic fields. It is estimated that the axial magnetic field contains 5-15 percent of the magnetic energy density. Model maps of 3C 279 are in qualitative agreement with VLBI maps and suggest that components on VLBI maps that are widely spaced in time, which hitherto have been assumed to a single, evolving component, are in fact a number of discrete events.},

Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multi-wavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to gamma-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the first detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy gamma-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a gamma-ray emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.},

Instead, most approaches rely on validation data, which may not be readily available. In this work, we present a scalable marginal-likelihood estimation method to select both hyperparameters and network architectures, based on the training data alone. Some hyperparameters can be estimated online during training, simplifying the procedure. Our marginal-likelihood estimate is based on Laplace's method and Gauss-Newton approximations to the Hessian, and it outperforms cross-validation and manual-tuning on standard regression and image classification datasets, especially in terms of calibration and out-of-distribution detection. Our work shows that marginal likelihoods can improve generalization and be useful when validation data is unavailable (e.g., in nonstationary settings).},

  abstract = {Blazars are highly variable active galactic nuclei which emit radiation at all wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays. Polarized radiation from blazars is one key piece of evidence for synchrotron radiation at low energies and it also varies dramatically. The polarization of blazars is of interest for understanding the origin, confinement, and propagation of jets. However, even though numerous measurements have been performed, the mechanisms behind jet creation, composition and variability are still debated. We performed simultaneous gamma-ray and optical photopolarimetry observations of 45 blazars between Jul. 2008 and Dec. 2014 to investigate the mechanisms of variability and search for a basic relation between the several subclasses of blazars. We identify a correlation between the maximum degree of optical linear polarization and the gamma-ray luminosity or the ratio of gamma-ray to optical fluxes. Since the maximum polarization degree depends on the condition of the magnetic field (chaotic or ordered), this result implies a systematic difference in the intrinsic alignment of magnetic fields in pc-scale relativistic jets between different types blazars (FSRQs vs. BL Lacs), and consequently between different types of radio galaxies (FR Is vs. FR IIs).},

  abstract = {The performance of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) polarimeter for the Polarimeter for Relativistic Astrophysical X-ray Sources (PRAXyS) Small Explorer was evaluated using polarized and unpolarized X-ray sources. The PRAXyS mission will enable exploration of the universe through X-ray polarimetry in the 2-10 keV energy band. We carried out performance tests of the polarimeter at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, National Synchrotron Light Source (BNL-NSLS) and at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The polarimeter was tested with linearly polarized, monochromatic X-rays at 11 different energies between 2.5 and 8.0 keV. At maximum sensitivity, the measured modulation factors at 2.7, 4.5 and 8.0 keV are 27\%, 43\% and 59\%, respectively and the measured angle of polarization is consistent with the expected value at all energies. Measurements with a broadband, unpolarized X-ray source placed a limit of less than 1\% on false polarization in the PRAXyS polarimeter.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are one of the dominant approaches in Bayesian learning. Although the approach has been applied to numerous problems with great success, it has a few fundamental limitations. Multiple methods in literature have addressed these limitations. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey of the topics as of yet. Most existing surveys focus on only one particular variant of Gaussian processes and their derivatives. This survey details the core motivations for using Gaussian processes, their mathematical formulations, limitations, and research themes that have flourished over the years to address said limitations. Furthermore, one particular research area is Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs), it has improved substantially in the past decade. The significant publications that advanced the forefront of this research area are outlined in their survey. Finally, a brief discussion on open problems and research directions for future work is presented at the end.},

Both the accuracy and computational efficiency of ABC depend on the choice of summary statistic, but outside of special cases where the optimal summary statistics are known, it is unclear which guiding principles can be used to construct effective summary statistics. In this paper we explore the possibility of automating the process of constructing summary statistics by training deep neural networks to predict the parameters from artificially generated data: the resulting summary statistics are approximately posterior means of the parameters. With minimal model-specific tuning, our method constructs summary statistics for the Ising model and the moving-average model, which match or exceed theoretically-motivated summary statistics in terms of the accuracies of the resulting posteriors.}

  abstract = {We describe the time-dependent radiation transfer in blazar jets within the internal shock model. We assume that the central engine, which consists of a black hole and an accretion disk, spews out relativistic shells of plasma with different velocities, masses, and energies. We consider a single inelastic collision between a faster (inner) and a slower (outer) moving shell. We study the dynamics of the collision and evaluate the subsequent emission of radiation via the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton processes after the interaction between the two shells has begun. The collision results in the formation of a forward shock and a reverse shock that convert the ordered bulk kinetic energy of the shells into magnetic field energy and accelerate the particles, which then radiate. We assume a cylindrical geometry for the emission region of the jet. We treat the self-consistent radiative transfer by taking into account the inhomogeneity in the photon density throughout the region. In this paper, we focus on understanding the effects of varying relevant input parameters on the simulated spectral energy distribution and spectral variability patterns.},

Time stepping for the distribution function is done explicitly with a third order strong-stability preserving Runge–Kutta method. Since the Vlasov equation in the Vlasov–Maxwell system is a high dimensional transport equation, up to six dimensions plus time, we take special care to note various features we have implemented to reduce the cost while maintaining the integrity of the solution, including the use of a reduced high-order basis set. A series of benchmarks, from simple wave and shock calculations, to a five dimensional turbulence simulation, are presented to verify the efficacy of our set of numerical methods, as well as demonstrate the power of the implemented features.},

  abstract = {An importance weight quantifies the relative importance of one example over another, coming up in applications of boosting, asymmetric classification costs, reductions, and active learning. The standard approach for dealing with importance weights in gradient descent is via multiplication of the gradient. We first demonstrate the problems of this approach when importance weights are large, and argue in favor of more sophisticated ways for dealing with them. We then develop an approach which enjoys an invariance property: that updating twice with importance weight h is equivalent to updating once with importance weight 2h. For many important losses this has a closed form update which satisfies standard regret guarantees when all examples have h = 1. We also briefly discuss two other reasonable approaches for handling large importance weights. Empirically, these approaches yield substantially superior prediction with similar computational performance while reducing the sensitivity of the algorithm to the exact setting of the learning rate. We apply these to online active learning yielding an extraordinarily fast active learning algorithm that works even in the presence of adversarial noise.},

  abstract = {Numerous deep learning applications benefit from multi-task learning with multiple regression and classification objectives. In this paper we make the observation that the performance of such systems is strongly dependent on the relative weighting between each task's loss. Tuning these weights by hand is a difficult and expensive process, making multi-task learning prohibitive in practice. We propose a principled approach to multi-task deep learning which weighs multiple loss functions by considering the homoscedastic uncertainty of each task. This allows us to simultaneously learn various quantities with different units or scales in both classification and regression settings. We demonstrate our model learning per-pixel depth regression, semantic and instance segmentation from a monocular input image. Perhaps surprisingly, we show our model can learn multi-task weightings and outperform separate models trained individually on each task.},

  abstract = {Humans and animals have a natural ability to quickly adapt to their surroundings, but machine-learning models, when subjected to changes, often require a complete retraining from scratch. We present Knowledge-adaptation priors (K-priors) to reduce the cost of retraining by enabling quick and accurate adaptation for a wide-variety of tasks and models. This is made possible by a combination of weight and function-space priors to reconstruct the gradients of the past, which recovers and generalizes many existing, but seemingly-unrelated, adaptation strategies. Training with simple first-order gradient methods can often recover the exact retrained model to an arbitrary accuracy by choosing a sufficiently large memory of the past data. Empirical results show that adaptation with K-priors achieves performance similar to full retraining, but only requires training on a handful of past examples.},

This paper proposes a deep CNN model, called CyCNN, which exploits polar mapping of input images to convert rotation to translation. To deal with the cylindrical property of the polar coordinates, we replace convolution layers in conventional CNNs to cylindrical convolutional (CyConv) layers. A CyConv layer exploits the cylindrically sliding windows (CSW) mechanism that vertically extends the input-image receptive fields of boundary units in a convolutional layer. We evaluate CyCNN and conventional CNN models for classification tasks on rotated MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that if there is no data augmentation during training, CyCNN significantly improves classification accuracies when compared to conventional CNN models. Our implementation of CyCNN is publicly available on https://github.com/mcrl/CyCNN.},

We find significant positive and negative correlations between radio and \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray fluxes in different time ranges. The time delays between radio and \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray emission suggest that the observed \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray flares originated from multiple regions upstream of the radio core, within a few parsecs from the central engine. Using time-resolved 43 GHz VLBA maps we identified 14 jet components moving downstream along the jet. Their apparent speeds range from 6 to 26 \$c\$, showing notable variations in their position angles upstream the stationary component (\$\textbackslash sim\$0.53 mas from the core). The brightness temperature declines as function of distance from the core according to a power-law which becomes shallower at the location of the stationary component. We also find that the periods at which significant correlations between radio and \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray emission occur overlap with the times when the jet was oriented to the north. Our results indicate that the passage of a propagating disturbance (or shock) through the radio core and the orientation of the jet might be responsible for the observed correlation between the radio and \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray variability. We present a scenario that connects the positive correlation and the unusual anti-correlation by combining the production of a flare and a dip at \$\textbackslash gamma\$-rays by a strong moving shock at different distances from the jet apex.},

Kim et al. used imaging and optogenetics in behaving flies to elucidate the functional architecture of the underlying neuronal network. They observed local excitation and global inhibition between the compass neurons. The features of the network were best explained by a ring attractor network model. Until now, this hypothesized network structure has been difficult to demonstrate in a real brain. Science, this issue p. 849 Ring attractors are a class of recurrent networks hypothesized to underlie the representation of heading direction. Such network structures, schematized as a ring of neurons whose connectivity depends on their heading preferences, can sustain a bump-like activity pattern whose location can be updated by continuous shifts along either turn direction. We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal’s heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics. A network with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation. Ring attractor networks have long been invoked in theoretical work; our study provides physiological evidence of their existence and functional architecture. A neuronal network in the fly brain uses global inhibition and local excitation to enforce an internal representation of heading direction. A neuronal network in the fly brain uses global inhibition and local excitation to enforce an internal representation of heading direction.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {X-ray polarimetry promises to deliver unique information about the geometry of the inner accretion flow of astrophysical black holes and the nature of matter and electromagnetism in and around neutron stars. In this paper, we discuss the possibility to use Stokes parameters – a commonly used tool in radio, infrared, and optical polarimetry – to analyze the data from X-ray polarimeters such as scattering polarimeters and photoelectric effect polarimeters, which measure the linear polarization of the detected X-rays. Based on the azimuthal scattering angle (in the case of a scattering polarimeter) or the azimuthal component of the angle of the electron ejection (in the case of a photoelectric effect polarimeter), the Stokes parameters can be calculated for each event recorded in the detector. Owing to the additive nature of Stokes parameters, the analysis reduces to adding the Stokes parameters of the individual events and subtracting the Stokes parameters characterizing the background (if present). The main strength of this kind of analysis is that the errors on the Stokes parameters can be computed easily and are well behaved – in stark contrast of the errors on the polarization fraction and polarization direction. We demonstrate the power of the Stokes analysis by deriving several useful formulae, e.g. the expected error on the polarization fraction and polarization direction for a detection of NS signal and NBG background events, the optimal observation times of the signal and background regions in the presence of non-negligible background contamination of the signal, and the minimum detectable polarization (MDP) that can be achieved when following this prescription.},

Due to its wide field of view it will survey the entire sky every 3 hours, enabling polarization measurements not only of persistent, but also of transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts. The polarization of gamma-rays carries geometric information about compact emission regions that are too small to be imaged at any wavelength, and will thus provide qualitatively new insights. In this paper we discuss AMEGO's polarization sensitivity based on detailed simulations of the instrument. We will use these results to discuss the scientific potential of AMEGO to search for violations of Lorentz invariance. Finally, we present predictions for possible observations based on theoretical models of bright gamma-ray bursts, blazar jets, and the high-energy tail of the galactic black hole binary Cygnus X-1. These predictions will demonstrate AMEGO's ability to distinguish different theoretical models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a data processing algorithm with machine learning for polarization extraction and event selection applied to photoelectron track images taken with X-ray polarimeters. The method uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) classification to predict the azimuthal angle and 2-D position of the initial photoelectron emission from a 2-D track image projected along the X-ray incident direction. Two CNN models are demonstrated with data sets generated by a Monte Carlo simulation: one has a commonly used loss function calculated by the cross entropy and the other has an additional loss term to penalize nonuniformity for an unpolarized modulation curve based on the \$H\$-test, which is used for periodic signal search in X-ray/\$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray astronomy. The modulation curve calculated by the former model with unpolarized data has several irregular features, which can be canceled out by unfolding the angular response or simulating the detector rotation. On the other hand, the latter model can predict a flat modulation curve with a residual systematic modulation down to \$\textbackslash lesssim1\$\%. Both models show almost the same modulation factors and position accuracy of less than 2 pixel (or 240 \$\textbackslash mu\$m) for all four test energies of 2.7, 4.5, 6.4, and 8.0 keV. In addition, event selection is performed based on probabilities from the CNN to maximize the polarization sensitivity considering a trade-off between the modulation factor and signal acceptance. The developed method with machine learning improves the polarization sensitivity by 10-20\%, compared to that determined with the image moment method developed previously.},

We allow at the final layer transfer functions such as the softmax function that need to consider the linear activations to all the output neurons. The weight vectors used to produce the linear activations are represented indirectly by maintaining separate parameter vectors. We get the weight vector by applying a particular parameterization function to the parameter vector. Updating the parameter vectors upon seeing new examples is done additively, as in the usual gradient descent update. However, by using a nonlinear parameterization function between the parameter vectors and the weight vectors, we can make the resulting update of the weight vector quite different from a true gradient descent update. To analyse such updates, we define a notion of a matching loss function and apply it both to the transfer function and to the parameterization function. The loss function that matches the transfer function is used to measure the goodness of the predictions of the algorithm. The loss function that matches the parameterization function can be used both as a measure of divergence between models in motivating the update rule of the algorithm and as a measure of progress in analyzing its relative performance compared to an arbitrary fixed model. As a result, we have a unified treatment that generalizes earlier results for the gradient descent and exponentiated gradient algorithms to multidimensional outputs, including multiclass logistic regression.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) are powerful black box predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

We analyze total and polarized intensity images of the blazar obtained with the VLBA at 43 GHz during and after the outburst. Monotonic rotation of the linear polarization vector at a rate of {$>\sptilde$} 50° per night coincided with a sharp maximum in γ-ray and optical flux. At the same time, within the uncertainties, a new superluminal knot appeared with an apparent speed of 21 ± 2c. The general multi-frequency behavior of the outburst can be explained within the framework of a shock wave propagating along a helical path in the blazar's jet.},

  abstract = {In Hezaveh et al. we showed that deep learning can be used for model parameter estimation and trained convolutional neural networks to determine the parameters of strong gravitational-lensing systems. Here we demonstrate a method for obtaining the uncertainties of these parameters. We review the framework of variational inference to obtain approximate posteriors of Bayesian neural networks and apply it to a network trained to estimate the parameters of the Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid plus external shear and total flux magnification. We show that the method can capture the uncertainties due to different levels of noise in the input data, as well as training and architecture-related errors made by the network. To evaluate the accuracy of the resulting uncertainties, we calculate the coverage probabilities of marginalized distributions for each lensing parameter. By tuning a single variational parameter, the dropout rate, we obtain coverage probabilities approximately equal to the confidence levels for which they were calculated, resulting in accurate and precise uncertainty estimates. Our results suggest that the application of approximate Bayesian neural networks to astrophysical modeling problems can be a fast alternative to Monte Carlo Markov Chains, allowing orders of magnitude improvement in speed.},

  abstract = {The key to photoelectric X-ray polarimetry is the determination of the emission direction of photoelectrons. Because of the low mass of an electron, the ionisation trajectory is not straight and the useful information needed for polarimetry is stored mostly in the initial part of the track where less energy is deposited. We present a new algorithm, based on the shortest path problem in graph theory, to reconstruct the 2D electron track from the measured image that is blurred due to transversal diffusion along drift and multiplication in the gas chamber. Compared with previous methods based on moment analysis, this algorithm allows us to identify the photoelectric interaction point more accurately and precisely for complicated tracks resulting from high energy photons or low pressure chambers. This leads to a better position resolution and a higher degree of modulation toward high energy X-rays. The new algorithm is justified using simulations and measurements with the gas pixel detector (GPD), and it should also work for other polarimetric techniques such as a time projection chamber (TPC). As the improvement is restricted in the high energy band, this new algorithm shows limited improvement for the sensitivity of GPD polarimeters, but it may have a larger potential for low-pressure TPC polarimeters.},

  abstract = {Natural-gradient descent (NGD) on structured parameter spaces (e.g., low-rank covariances) is computationally challenging due to difficult Fisher-matrix computations. We address this issue by using \textbackslash emph\{local-parameter coordinates\} to obtain a flexible and efficient NGD method that works well for a wide-variety of structured parameterizations. We show four applications where our method (1) generalizes the exponential natural evolutionary strategy, (2) recovers existing Newton-like algorithms, (3) yields new structured second-order algorithms via matrix groups, and (4) gives new algorithms to learn covariances of Gaussian and Wishart-based distributions. We show results on a range of problems from deep learning, variational inference, and evolution strategies. Our work opens a new direction for scalable structured geometric methods.},

  abstract = {Blazars are known for their energetic multiwavelength flares from radio wavelengths to high-energy \$\textbackslash gamma\$-rays. In this work, we study radio, optical, and \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray light curves of 145 bright blazars spanning up to 8\textasciitilde yr, to probe the flaring activity and interband correlations. Of these, 105 show \${$>$}1\textbackslash sigma\$ correlations between one or more wavebands, 26 of which have a \${$>$}3\textbackslash sigma\$ correlation in at least one wavelength pair, as measured by the discrete correlation function. The most common and strongest correlations are found between the optical and \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray bands, with fluctuations simultaneous within our \$\textbackslash sim 30\$\textasciitilde d resolution. The radio response is usually substantially delayed with respect to the other wavelengths with median time lags of \$\textbackslash sim 100\$--160\textasciitilde d. A systematic flare identification via Bayesian block analysis provides us with a first uniform sample of flares in the three bands, allowing us to characterise the relative rates of multiband and "orphan" flares. Multiband flares tend to have higher amplitudes than "orphan" flares.},

  abstract = {X-ray polarization should provide new probes of magnetic field geometry and acceleration physics near the base of blazar jets, but near-future missions will have limited sensitivity. We thus use existing lower energy data and X-ray variability measurements in the context of a basic synchro-Compton model to predict the X-ray polarization level and the probability of detection success for individual sources, listing the most attractive candidates for an IXPE campaign. We find that, as expected, several high-peak blazars such as Mrk 421 can be easily measured in 100 ksec exposures. Most low peak sources should only be accessible to triggered campaigns during bright flares. Surprisingly, a few intermediate peak sources can have anomalously high X-ray polarization and thus are attractive targets.},

  abstract = {We describe the parsec-scale kinematics of 200 active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets based on 15 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data obtained between 1994 August 31 and 2011 May 1. We present new VLBA 15 GHz images of these and 59 additional AGNs from the MOJAVE and 2 cm Survey programs. Nearly all of the 60 most heavily observed jets show significant changes in their innermost position angle over a 12-16 yr interval, ranging from 10° to 150° on the sky, corresponding to intrinsic variations of 0.°5 to 2°. The BL Lac jets show smaller variations than quasars. Roughly half of the heavily observed jets show systematic position angle trends with time, and 20 show indications of oscillatory behavior. The time spans of the data sets are too short compared to the fitted periods (5-12 yr), however, to reliably establish periodicity. The rapid changes and large jumps in position angle seen in many cases suggest that the superluminal AGN jet features occupy only a portion of the entire jet cross section and may be energized portions of thin instability structures within the jet. We have derived vector proper motions for 887 moving features in 200 jets having at least five VLBA epochs. For 557 well-sampled features, there are sufficient data to additionally study possible accelerations. We find that the moving features are generally non-ballistic, with 70\% of the well-sampled features showing either significant accelerations or non-radial motions. Inward motions are rare (2\% of all features), are slow ({$<$}0.1 mas yr –1 ), are more prevalent in BL Lac jets, and are typically found within 1 mas of the unresolved core feature. There is a general trend of increasing apparent speed with distance down the jet for both radio galaxies and BL Lac objects. In most jets, the speeds of the features cluster around a characteristic value, yet there is a considerable dispersion in the distribution. Orientation variations within the jet cannot fully account for the dispersion, implying that the features have a range of Lorentz factor and/or pattern speed. Very slow pattern speed features are rare, comprising only 4\% of the sample, and are more prevalent in radio galaxy and BL Lac jets. We confirm a previously reported upper envelope to the distribution of speed versus beamed luminosity for moving jet features. Below 10 26 W Hz –1 there is a fall-off in maximum speed with decreasing 15 GHz radio luminosity. The general shape of the envelope implies that the most intrinsically powerful AGN jets have a wide range of Lorentz factors up to 40, while intrinsically weak jets are only mildly relativistic.},

To this end, we introduce two quantities which can be easily evaluated, the composite gradient and the implicit noise. Results are established on integrator stability and geometric convergence, and we show that choices of kinetic energy that result in heavy-tailed momentum distributions can exhibit an undesirable negligible moves property, which we define. A general efficiency-robustness trade off is outlined, and implementations which rely on approximate gradients are also discussed. Two numerical studies illustrate our theoretical findings, showing that the standard choice which results in a Gaussian momentum distribution is not always optimal in terms of either robustness or efficiency.},

These pulsars were found in the Green Bank North Celestial Cap pulsar survey, an all-GBT-sky survey being carried out at a frequency of 350 MHz. We include pulsar timing data from the Green Bank Telescope and Low Frequency Array. Our sample includes five fully recycled millisecond pulsars (MSPs, three of which are in a binary system), a new relativistic double neutron star system, an intermediate mass binary pulsar, a mode-changing pulsar, a 138-ms pulsar with a very low magnetic field, and several nulling pulsars. We have measured two post-Keplerian parameters and thus the masses of both objects in the double neutron star system. We also report a tentative companion mass measurement via Shapiro delay in a binary MSP. Two of the MSPs can be timed with high precision and have been included in pulsar timing arrays being used to search for low-frequency gravitational waves, while a third MSP is a member of the black widow class of binaries. Proper motion is measurable in five pulsars and we provide an estimate of their space velocity. We report on an optical counterpart to a new black widow system and provide constraints on the optical counterparts to other binary MSPs. We also present a preliminary analysis of nulling pulsars in our sample. These results demonstrate the scientific return of long timing campaigns on pulsars of all types.},

  abstract = {We present a model of blazar variability that can both reproduce smooth large polarization angle swings, and at the same time allow for the seemingly random behaviour of synchrotron fluxes, polarization fraction and, occasionally, \$\textbackslash pi\$/2 polarization jumps. We associate blazar flaring activity with a jet carrying helical magnetic fields and propagating along a variable direction (and possibly with a changing bulk Lorentz factor). The model predicts that for various jet trajectories (i) EVPA can experience large smooth temporal variations while at the same time polarization fraction (\$\textbackslash Pi\$) can be highly variable; (ii) \$\textbackslash Pi \textbackslash sim 0\$ near sudden EVPA jumps of 90\$\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$, but can also remain constant for large, smoother EVPA swings; (iii) the total angle of EVPA rotation can be arbitrary large; (iv) intensity I is usually maximal at points of fastest EVPA changes, but can have a minimum. Thus, even for a regular, deterministic motion of a steadily emitting jet the observed properties can vary in a non-monotonic and/or seemingly stochastic way. Intrinsic fluctuations of the emissivity will further complicated the intensity profiles, but are expected to preserve the polarization structure.},

  abstract = {We propose a family of optimization methods that achieve linear convergence using first-order gradient information and constant step sizes on a class of convex functions much larger than the smooth and strongly convex ones. This larger class includes functions whose second derivatives may be singular or unbounded at their minima. Our methods are discretizations of conformal Hamiltonian dynamics, which generalize the classical momentum method to model the motion of a particle with non-standard kinetic energy exposed to a dissipative force and the gradient field of the function of interest. They are first-order in the sense that they require only gradient computation. Yet, crucially the kinetic gradient map can be designed to incorporate information about the convex conjugate in a fashion that allows for linear convergence on convex functions that may be non-smooth or non-strongly convex. We study in detail one implicit and two explicit methods. For one explicit method, we provide conditions under which it converges to stationary points of non-convex functions. For all, we provide conditions on the convex function and kinetic energy pair that guarantee linear convergence, and show that these conditions can be satisfied by functions with power growth. In sum, these methods expand the class of convex functions on which linear convergence is possible with first-order computation.},

However, that is not to say that the traditional computer vision techniques which had been undergoing progressive development in years prior to the rise of DL have become obsolete. This paper will analyse the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. The aim of this paper is to promote a discussion on whether knowledge of classical computer vision techniques should be maintained. The paper will also explore how the two sides of computer vision can be combined. Several recent hybrid methodologies are reviewed which have demonstrated the ability to improve computer vision performance and to tackle problems not suited to Deep Learning. For example, combining traditional computer vision techniques with Deep Learning has been popular in emerging domains such as Panoramic Vision and 3D vision for which Deep Learning models have not yet been fully optimised},

The requirement of transparency for gamma-rays, together with the observation of rapid variability, imply that the high-energy radiation is anisotropic. It is proposed that the gamma-rays are produced in a relativistic jet via the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism. The gamma-ray spectrum is the high-energy extension of the inverse Compton radiation responsible for the X-ray emission. It is softer than the X-ray spectrum, owing to upper cutoffs in the electron energy spectra along the jet. The same electrons are responsible for the low-frequency emission via synchrotron radiation. The expected correlation of variability at different frequencies is discussed.},

  abstract = {The author presents a model for variability of the flux and polarization  of blazars in which turbulent plasma flowing at a relativistic speed down a jet crosses a standing conical shock. The shock compresses the plasma and accelerates electrons to energies up to γmax {$>\sptilde$} 104 times their rest-mass energy, with the value of γmax determined by the direction of the magnetic field relative to the shock front. The turbulence is approximated in a computer code as many cells, each with a uniform magnetic field whose direction is selected randomly. The density of high-energy electrons in the plasma changes randomly with time in a manner consistent with the power spectral density of flux variations derived from observations of blazars. The variations in flux and polarization are therefore caused by continuous noise processes rather than by singular events such as explosive injection of energy at the base of the jet. Sample simulations illustrate the behavior of flux and linear polarization versus time that such a model produces. The variations in γ-ray flux generated by the code are often, but not always, correlated with those at lower frequencies, and many of the flares are sharply peaked. The mean degree of polarization of synchrotron radiation is higher and its timescale of variability shorter toward higher frequencies, while the polarization electric vector sometimes randomly executes apparent rotations. The slope of the spectral energy distribution exhibits sharper breaks than can arise solely from energy losses. All of these results correspond to properties observed in blazars.},

Optimal estimators are provided for the cases of binned and unbinned data and applied to data such as might be obtained for faint or weakly polarized sources observed using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer. For a sample situation, the improvement in the minimum detectable polarization is 6\%–7\% using a count-weighted rms of the modulation factor, when compared to a count-weighted average. Improving the modulation factor, such as when using a neural network approach to Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer event tracks, can provide additional improvement up to 10\%–15\%.

  abstract = {Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used 'empirical' approximation of the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also holds for certain other curvature matrices, but notably not the Hessian).}

  abstract = {We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.}

The intensity-time profile of the relativistic protons derived from the neutron monitor data indicates two successive peaks. We show that microwave, hard X-ray and gamma-ray emissions display several episodes of particle acceleration within the impulsive flare phase. The first relativistic protons detected at Earth are accelerated together with relativistic electrons and with protons that produce pion decay gamma-rays during the second episode. The second peak in the relativistic proton profile at Earth is accompanied by new signatures of particle acceleration in the corona within approximatively 1 solar radius above the photosphere, revealed by hard X-ray and microwave emissions of low intensity, and by the renewed radio emission of electron beams and of a coronal shock wave. We discuss the observations in terms of different scenarios of particle acceleration in the corona.},

  abstract = {We investigate the polarization properties of Comptonized X-rays from relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using Monte Carlo simulations. We consider three scenarios commonly proposed for the observed X-ray emission in AGN: Compton scattering of blackbody photons emitted from an accretion disk; scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons; and self-Comptonization of intrinsically polarized synchrotron photons emitted by jet electrons. Our simulations show that for Comptonization of disk and CMB photons, the degree of polarization of the scattered photons increases with the viewing inclination angle with respect to the jet axis. In both cases the maximum linear polarization is approximately 20\%. In the case of synchrotron self-Comptonization (SSC), we find that the resulting X-ray polarization depends strongly on the seed synchrotron photon injection site, with typical fractional polarizations of approximately P = 10 - 20\% when synchrotron emission is localized near the jet base, while P = 20 - 70\% for the case of uniform emission throughout the jet. These results indicate that X-ray polarimetry may be capable of providing unique clues to identify the location of particle acceleration sites in relativistic jets. In particular, if synchrotron photons are emitted quasi-uniformly throughout a jet, then the observed degree of X-ray polarization may be sufficiently different for each of the competing X-ray emission mechanisms (synchrotron, SSC or external Comptonization) to determine which is the dominant process. However, X-ray polarimetry alone is unlikely to be able to distinguish between disk and CMB Comptonization.},

  abstract = {We have obtained high dynamic range, good natural seeing i′ images of BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) to search for the active galactic nucleus host and thus constrain the source redshift. These objects are drawn from a sample of bright flat-spectrum radio sources that are either known (via recent Fermi Large Area Telescope observations) gamma-ray emitters or similar sources that might be detected in continuing gamma-ray observations. All had spectroscopic confirmation as BL Lac sources, but no redshift solution. We detected hosts for 25/49 objects. As these galaxies have been argued to be standard candles, our measured host magnitudes provide redshift estimates (ranging from 0.2 to 1.0). Lower bounds are established on the redshifts of non-detections. The mean of the fit redshifts (and lower limits) is higher than those of spectroscopic solutions in the radio-loud and gamma-ray-loud parent samples, suggesting corrections may be needed for the luminosity function and evolution of these sources.}

  abstract = {Velocity measurements made from multiple-epoch astronomical images of evolving objects with optically thin continuum emission (e.g. as relativistic jets or expanding supernova shells) may be confused as a result of the overlap of semi-transparent features moving at different speeds. Multi-scale wavelet decomposition can be effectively applied to identify and track such overlapping features, provided that their respective structural responses can be separated over the spatial scales used for the decomposition. We developed a new method that combines the stacked cross-correlation with the wavelet-based image segmentation and evaluation (WISE) technique of decomposition of two-dimensional structures, to separate and track dominant spatial responses of overlapping evolving features. The method is tested on a set of simulated images of a stratified relativistic jet, demonstrating the robust detection of both the faster spine and the slower sheath speeds. The method is applied to mutliple-epoch images from the MOJAVE survey, revealing two different superluminal streams inside the jet in 3C 273 and the acceleration of the flow in 3C 120. The method can be applied to densely monitored objects with composite structural evolution such as the parsec-scale jet in M87 or heavily resolved expanding supernova shells.},

  abstract = {Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) imaging of radio emission from extragalactic jets provides a unique probe of physical mechanisms governing the launching, acceleration, and collimation of relativistic outflows. The two-dimensional structure and kinematics of the jet in M\textbackslash,87 (NGC\textbackslash,4486) have been studied by applying the Wavelet-based Image Segmentation and Evaluation (WISE) method to 11 images obtained from multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations made in January-August 2007 at 43 GHz (\$\textbackslash lambda = 7\$ mm). The WISE analysis recovers a detailed two-dimensional velocity field in the jet in M\textbackslash,87 at sub-parsec scales. The observed evolution of the flow velocity with distance from the jet base can be explained in the framework of MHD jet acceleration and Poynting flux conversion. A linear acceleration regime is observed up to \$z\_\{obs\} \textbackslash sim 2\$\textbackslash,mas. The acceleration is reduced at larger scales, which is consistent with saturation of Poynting flux conversion. Stacked cross correlation analysis of the images reveals a pronounced stratification of the flow. The flow consists of a slow, mildly relativistic layer (moving at \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash sim 0.5\textbackslash,c\$), associated either with instability pattern speed or an outer wind, and a fast, accelerating stream line (with \$\textbackslash beta \textbackslash sim 0.92\$, corresponding to a bulk Lorentz factor \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash sim 2.5\$). A systematic difference of the apparent speeds in the northern and southern limbs of the jet is detected, providing evidence for jet rotation. The angular velocity of the magnetic field line associated with this rotation suggests that the jet in M87 is launched in the inner part of the disk, at a distance \$r\_0 \textbackslash sim 5\textbackslash, R\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}\$ from the central engine. The combined results of the analysis imply that MHD acceleration and conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic energy play the dominant roles in collimation and acceleration of the flow in M\textbackslash,87.},

In this work, we explored statistical properties of the X-ray variability in the blazars S5 0716+714, OJ 287, Mkn 501, and RBS 2070 using the archival observations from the XMM-Newton telescope between the period 2002-2020. Several methods of timing and spectral analyses, including fractional variability, minimum variability time-scale, power spectral density analyses, and countrate distribution, were performed. In addition, we fitted various spectral models to the observations, as well as estimated hardness ratio. The results show that the sources are moderately variable within the intraday time-scale. Three of the four sources exhibited a clear bi-modal pattern in their countrate distribution, revealing possible indication of two distinct countrate states, that is, hard and soft countrate states. The slope indices of the power spectral density were found to be centred around 0.5. Furthermore, the spectra of the sources were fitted with single power law, broken power law, log-parabolic, and blackbody + log-parabolic models (the latter only for OJ 287). We conclude that for most of the observations log-parabolic model was the best fit. The power-spectral-density analysis revealed the variable nature of PSD slopes in the source light curves. The results of this analysis could indicate the non-stationary nature of the blazar processes on intraday time-scales. The observed features can be explained within the context of current blazar models, in which the non-thermal emission mostly arises from kilo-pc scale relativistic jets.},

Variability time scales were estimated from the rates of magnitude variation, which were found to have a distribution function well fitted by an exponential law with a mean value of 0.027 mag/h, corresponding to an e-folding time scale of the flux τ\textsubscript{F} = 37.6 h. The highest rates of magnitude variation were around 0.10-0.12 mag/h and lasted less than 2 h. These rates were observed only when the source had an R magnitude \&lt;13.4, but this finding cannot be considered significant because of the low statistical occurrence. The distribution of τ\textsubscript{F} has a well-defined modal value at 19 h. Assuming the recent estimate of the beaming factor δ ∼ 20, we derived a typical size of the emitting region of about 5× 10\textsuperscript{16}/(1 + z) cm.

  abstract = {Order of magnitude variability has been observed in the blazar sub-class of Active Galactic Nuclei on minute timescales. Such fast high energy flares are often difficult to explain with conventional shock acceleration models due to the small size of the emitting region inferred by the light crossing time. Recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that magnetic reconnection may offer a viable explanation. In this paper, we present a macroscopic emission model physically motivated by PIC simulations, where the energy for particle acceleration originates from the reconnecting magnetic field. We track the radial growth and relative velocity of a reconnecting plasmoid, modelling particle acceleration and radiative losses, which occur via synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission. We assume the reconnection layer consists of merging plasmoids, which grow as they merge. We use our model to successfully fit to the 2016 TeV flare of BL Lacertae, demonstrating that reconnection is able to produce TeV flares on the observed timescales. We find that the flaring light curve depends on the merge timescale and the magnetisation of the emitting plasma. However, the SEDs produced by our model are all synchrotron-dominated, and observable reconnection plasmoids have radii comparable to the jet radius. We conclude that while reconnection powered SSC flares can produce flares on the correct timescale, the primary source of emission cannot be SSC and the size of plasmoids required may be implausibly large.},

  abstract = {We review the tools and procedures for the analysis of the data collected by X-ray photoelectric gas polarimeters, like the ones on-board the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Although many of such tools are in principle common with polarimeters working at other energy bands, the peculiar characteristics and performance of these devices require a specific approach. We will start from the analysis of the raw data read-out from this kind of instruments, that is, the image of the track of the photoelectron. We will briefly present how such images are processed with highly-specialized algorithms to extract all the information collected by the instrument. These include energy, time of arrival and, possibly, absorption point of the photon, in addition to the initial direction of emission of the photoelectron. The last is the quantity relevant for polarimetry, and we will present different methods to obtain the polarization degree and angle from it. A simple method, used extensively especially during the development phase of X-ray photoelectric gas polarimeters, is based on the construction and fitting of the azimuthal distribution of the photoelectrons. We will discuss that there are several reasons to prefer an analysis based on Stokes parameters, especially when one wants to analyze measurements of real, i.e., not laboratory, sources. These are quantities commonly used at all wavelengths because they are additive, and then operations like background subtraction or the application of calibration are trivial to apply. We will summarize how Stokes parameters can be used to adapt current spectroscopy software based on forward folding fitting to perform spectro-polarimetry. Moreover, we will derive how to properly associate the statistical uncertainty on a polarimetry measurement and the relation with another statistical indicator, which is in the minimum detectable polarization.},

The choice of the mixture in which X-ray photons are absorbed and photoelectrons propagate, deeply affects both the energy range of the instrument and its performance in terms of gain, track dimension and ultimately, polarimetric sensitivity. Here we present the characterization of the Gas Pixel Detector with a 1 cm thick cell filled with dimethyl ether (DME) at 0.79 atm, selected among other mixtures for the very low diffusion coefficient. Almost completely polarized and monochromatic photons were produced at the calibration facility built at INAF/IASF-Rome exploiting Bragg diffraction at nearly 45°. For the first time ever, we measured the modulation factor and the spectral capabilities of the instrument at energies as low as 2.0 keV, but also at 2.6, 3.7, 4.0, 5.2 and 7.8 keV. These measurements cover almost completely the energy range of the instrument and allows to compare the sensitivity achieved with that of the standard mixture, composed of helium and DME.},

  abstract = {This paper describes and discusses Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). The paper showcases a few different applications of them for classification and regression problems. BNNs are comprised of a Probabilistic Model and a Neural Network. The intent of such a design is to combine the strengths of Neural Networks and Stochastic modeling. Neural Networks exhibit continuous function approximator capabilities. Stochastic models allow direct specification of a model with known interaction between parameters to generate data. During the prediction phase, stochastic models generate a complete posterior distribution and produce probabilistic guarantees on the predictions. Thus BNNs are a unique combination of neural network and stochastic models with the stochastic model forming the core of this integration. BNNs can then produce probabilistic guarantees on it's predictions and also generate the distribution of parameters that it has learnt from the observations. That means, in the parameter space, one can deduce the nature and shape of the neural network's learnt parameters. These two characteristics makes them highly attractive to theoreticians as well as practitioners. Recently there has been a lot of activity in this area, with the advent of numerous probabilistic programming libraries such as: PyMC3, Edward, Stan etc. Further this area is rapidly gaining ground as a standard machine learning approach for numerous problems},

  abstract = {This paper presents a simple model of polarisation rotation in optically thin relativistic jets of blazars. The model is based on the development of helical (kink) mode of current-driven instability. A possible explanation is suggested for the observational connection between polarisation rotations and optical/gamma-ray flares in blazars, if the current-driven modes are triggered by secular increases of the total jet power. The importance of intrinsic depolarisation in limiting the amplitude of coherent polarisation rotations is demonstrated. The polarisation rotation amplitude is thus very sensitive to the viewing angle, which appears to be inconsistent with the observational estimates of viewing angles in blazars showing polarisation rotations. Overall, there are serious obstacles to explaining large-amplitude polarisation rotations in blazars in terms of current-driven kink modes.},

  abstract = {A meme ( MEEM) is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—often with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures. Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influences a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts. A field of study called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety of fronts has challenged the notion that academic study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study possible. Some commentators in the social sciences question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are especially critical of the biological nature of the theory's underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a misunderstanding of the original proposal. The word meme is a neologism coined by Richard Dawkins. It originated from Dawkins' 1976 book The Selfish Gene. Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he welcomed N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that "memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically" and proposed to regard memes as "physically residing in the brain". Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.},

  abstract = {Modern machine learning methods including deep learning have achieved great success in predictive accuracy for supervised learning tasks, but may still fall short in giving useful estimates of their predictive \{\textbackslash em uncertainty\}. Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration. We find that traditional post-hoc calibration does indeed fall short, as do several other previous methods. However, some methods that marginalize over models give surprisingly strong results across a broad spectrum of tasks.},

This re-classification is based on: (1) its radio and O II luminosities; (2) its emission line ratios; (3) its Eddington ratio. We also point out that the synchrotron peak frequency of TXS 0506+056 is more than two orders of magnitude larger than expected by the so-called "blazar sequence", a scenario which has been assumed by some theoretical models predicting neutrino (and cosmic-ray) emission from blazars. Finally, we comment on the theoretical implications this re-classification has on the location of the \$\textbackslash gamma\$-ray emitting region and our understanding of neutrino emission in blazars.},

We describe an approach for increasing the flexibility of an autoregressive model, based on modelling the random numbers that the model uses internally when generating data. By constructing a stack of autoregressive models, each modelling the random numbers of the next model in the stack, we obtain a type of normalizing flow suitable for density estimation, which we call Masked Autoregressive Flow. This type of flow is closely related to Inverse Autoregressive Flow and is a generalization of Real NVP. Masked Autoregressive Flow achieves state-of-the-art performance in a range of general-purpose density estimation tasks.},

  abstract = {Ensembles of neural networks (NNs) have long been used to estimate predictive uncertainty; a small number of NNs are trained from different initialisations and sometimes on differing versions of the dataset. The variance of the ensemble's predictions is interpreted as its epistemic uncertainty. The appeal of ensembling stems from being a collection of regular NNs - this makes them both scalable and easily implementable. They have achieved strong empirical results in recent years, often presented as a practical alternative to more costly Bayesian NNs (BNNs). The departure from Bayesian methodology is of concern since the Bayesian framework provides a principled, widely-accepted approach to handling uncertainty. In this extended abstract we derive and implement a modified NN ensembling scheme, which provides a consistent estimator of the Bayesian posterior in wide NNs - regularising parameters about values drawn from a prior distribution.},

  abstract = {Training deep neural networks is a very demanding task, especially challenging is how to adapt architectures to improve the performance of trained models. We can find that sometimes, shallow networks generalize better than deep networks, and the addition of more layers results in higher training and test errors. The deep residual learning framework addresses this degradation problem by adding skip connections to several neural network layers. It would at first seem counter-intuitive that such skip connections are needed to train deep networks successfully as the expressivity of a network would grow exponentially with depth. In this paper, we first analyze the flow of information through neural networks. We introduce and evaluate the batch-entropy which quantifies the flow of information through each layer of a neural network. We prove empirically and theoretically that a positive batch-entropy is required for gradient descent-based training approaches to optimize a given loss function successfully. Based on those insights, we introduce batch-entropy regularization to enable gradient descent-based training algorithms to optimize the flow of information through each hidden layer individually. With batch-entropy regularization, gradient descent optimizers can transform untrainable networks into trainable networks. We show empirically that we can therefore train a "vanilla" fully connected network and convolutional neural network -- no skip connections, batch normalization, dropout, or any other architectural tweak -- with 500 layers by simply adding the batch-entropy regularization term to the loss function. The effect of batch-entropy regularization is not only evaluated on vanilla neural networks, but also on residual networks, autoencoders, and also transformer models over a wide range of computer vision as well as natural language processing tasks.},

Local sampling allows for model parallelism when forming the preconditioner, removing the need for the extra backward pass.

Including the effects of jet divergence, particle cooling, and the relativistic PA rotation to the observer frame, we find that the multizone model recovers simple predictions for SSC polarization, but describes new dependencies on jet viewing geometry and zone multiplicity. Increasing the zone number decreases both synchrotron and SSC polarization, but with different scaling. A rise in synchrotron polarization fraction ΠSync at high energies is guaranteed by basic relativity considerations, and strengthened by jet nonuniformity. Finite light travel time effects can suppress the synchrotron polarization at energies well below the ν Sync peak. In general ΠSync and ΠSSC are correlated with ΠSSC/ΠSync ≈ 0.3, but individual realizations can lie far from this trend. This study lets us estimate Π across the SED, leading to predictions in the X-ray band helpful for planning observations with IXPE and other upcoming X-ray polarization missions.},

Some intermediate synchrotron peaked blazars transition from their low- to high-energy emission components in the X-ray band making them excellent laboratories to probe both components simultaneously, and good targets for the newly launched Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We characterize the spectral energy distributions for three such blazars, CGRaBS J0211+1051, TXS 0506+056, and S5 0716+714, predicting their X-ray polarization behavior by fitting a multizone polarized leptonic jet model. We find that a significant detection of electron synchrotron dominated polarization is possible with a 300 ks observation for S5 0716+714 and CGRaBS J0211+1051 in their flaring states, while even 500 ks observations are unlikely to measure synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) polarization. Importantly, nonleptonic emission processes like proton synchrotron are marginally detectable for our brightest intermediate synchrotron peaked blazar (ISP), S5 0716+714, during a flaring state. Improved IXPE data reduction methods or next-generation telescopes like eXTP are needed to confidently measure SSC polarization.},

  abstract = {Powerful flares from blazars with short (\$\textbackslash sim\$ min) variability timescales are challenging for current models of blazar emission. Here, we present a physically motivated ab initio model for blazar flares based on the results of recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic magnetic reconnection. PIC simulations demonstrate that quasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic fields are a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process. By coupling our PIC-based results (i.e., plasmoid growth, acceleration profile, particle and magnetic content) with a kinetic equation for the evolution of the electron distribution function we demonstrate that relativistic reconnection in blazar jets can produce powerful flares whose temporal and spectral properties are consistent with the observations. In particular, our model predicts correlated synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton flares of duration of several hours--days powered by the largest and slowest moving plasmoids that form in the reconnection layer. Smaller and faster plasmoids produce flares of sub-hour duration with higher peak luminosities than those powered by the largest plasmoids. Yet, the observed fluence in both types of flares is similar. Multiple flares with a range of flux-doubling timescales (minutes to several hours) observed over a longer period of flaring activity (days or longer) may be used as a probe of the reconnection layer's orientation and the jet's magnetization. Our model shows that blazar flares are naturally expected as a result of magnetic reconnection in a magnetically-dominated jet.},

  abstract = {Recently we have shown that high-energy neutrinos above 200 TeV detected by IceCube are produced within several parsecs in the central regions of radio-bright blazars, that is active galactic nuclei with jets pointing toward us. To independently test this result and extend the analysis to a wider energy range, we use public data for all neutrino energies from seven years of IceCube observations. The IceCube point-source likelihood map is analyzed against the positions of blazars from a statistically complete sample selected according to their compact radio flux density. The latter analysis delivers a 3.0σ significance, with the combined post-trial significance of both studies being 4.1σ. The correlation is driven by a large number of blazars. Together with fainter but physically similar sources not included in the sample, they may explain the entire IceCube astrophysical neutrino flux as derived from muon-track analyses. The neutrinos can be produced in interactions of relativistic protons with X-ray self-Compton photons in parsec-scale blazar jets.}

  abstract = {In the first of a series of papers investigating emission from blazar jets from radio to high-energy \{\textbackslash gamma\}-rays, we revisit the class of models where the jet has a uniform conical ballistic structure. We argue that by using simple developments of these models, in the context of new multi-frequency data extending to gamma-ray energies, valuable insights may be obtained into the properties that fully realistic models must ultimately have. In this paper we consider the synchrotron and synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the jet, modelling the recent simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of BL Lac. This is the first time these components have been fitted simultaneously for a blazar using a conical jet model. In the model we evolve the electron population dynamically along the jet taking into account the synchrotron and inverse-Compton losses. The inverse-Compton emission is calculated using the Klein-Nishina cross section and a relativistic transformation into the jet frame, and we explicitly show the seed photon population. We integrate synchrotron opacity along the line of sight through the jet plasma, taking into account the emission and opacity of each section of the jet. In agreement with previous studies of radio emission, we find that a conical jet model which conserves magnetic energy produces the characteristic blazar flat radio spectrum, however, we do not require any fine-tuning of the model to achieve this. Of particular note, in our model fit to BL Lac--which at \textasciitilde 10\^37W is a relatively low jet-power source--we find no requirement for significant re-acceleration within the jet to explain the observed spectrum.},

The first one is optically thin synchrotron self-Compton emission from an isotropic distribution of relativistic electrons with a power-law energy spectrum in aligned magnetic field. It is shown that the polarization degree of the scattered radiation is angle dependent in contrast to the initial synchrotron radiation. The second process is radiation from an accretion flow scattered off a relativistic jet. In that case I assume that electrons have a relativistic Maxwellian distribution in the frame of reference connected with the jet. The dependence of polarization on angles for different electron temperatures is obtained.},

  abstract = {We observed the X-ray binary pulsar GX 301-2 with ASCA (Astro-D) on 1994 February 13-14 at orbital phase ∼0.3, when the X-ray emission is in a nonflaring state. We also obtained BATSE/GRO observations of the total high-energy flux concurrent with the ASCA observation, as well as before and after. The BATSE data cover 7.5 orbital periods from 1993 September 20 to 1994 July 28. We folded these data over the orbital period and found that the preperiastron (PP) flare is asymmetric it rises more slowly than it falls. We also detected a periodic near-apastron (NA) flare. Both the asymmetry of the PP flare and the existence of the NA flare can be explained by an equatorially enhanced stellar wind or a circumstellar disk around the optical companion WRA 977 that GX 301-2 crosses twice per orbit. We measured the GX 301-2 pulse period to be 675.7±0.1 s, the lowest value observed to date. This demonstrates that the spin-up that started in 1984 continues and is the longest lasting secular spin-up of the known pulsars. The secular spin-up indicates that an accretion disk has formed. The appearance of the NA flare may be related to the secular spin-up if the circumstellar disk also provides a steady source of angular momentum to the neutron star. The ASCA Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS) and Solid-state Imaging Spectrometer (SIS) images indicate the presence of two previously unknown soft X-ray sources 3' and 8' from GX 301-2. The brighter source at 8' we identify as a dMe star. Both sources have contributed to prior observations of the low-energy GX 301-2 spectrum. We have combined the nearly simultaneous spectral data from ASCA and BATSE to determine the pulse-phase averaged 4-60 keV spectrum of GX 301-2. It fits a power4aw model with low energy absorption, a narrow iron emission line, an iron absorption edge, and a high-energy cutoff. We measured the SISO/ASCA iron line energy to be 6.41±0.02 keV, the energy for neutral iron or with an ionization state no higher than Fe XVII. The iron line equivalent width is 230±30 eV, with 43 eV {$<$} intrinsic width {$<$}74 eV (90\% confidence). The iron edge is at 7.19±0.03 keV. The line and edge energies are consistent with the same iron ionization state if the state is no higher than Fe V.},

  abstract = {Given sparse or low-quality radial velocity measurements of a star, there are often many qualitatively different stellar or exoplanet companion orbit models that are consistent with the data. The consequent multimodality of the likelihood function leads to extremely challenging search, optimization, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling over the orbital parameters. Here we create a custom Monte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial velocity measurements of two-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even when the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital parameters for a binary system can be split into four nonlinear parameters (period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters (velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a sampling method in which we densely sample the prior probability density function (pdf) in the nonlinear parameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function marginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the sampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense. With informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too sparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The method produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include as few as three epochs. The Joker can therefore be used to produce proper samplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in hierarchical (population) modeling. We give some examples that show how the posterior pdf depends sensitively on the number and time coverage of the observations and their uncertainties.},

We suggest that such an event can be explained in terms of a relativistic thin shock propagating through a uniform helical magnetic field, giving rise to relativistic aberration effects as the transverse field component rotates. The model may also be applicable to other similar events in which variations in polarization are not accompanied by variations in total flux density.},

  abstract = {Boundary vector cells in entorhinal cortex fire when a rat is in locations at a specific distance from walls of an environment. This firing may originate from memory of the barrier location combined with path integration, or the firing may depend upon the apparent visual input image stream. The modeling work presented here investigates the role of optic flow, the apparent change of patterns of light on the retina, as input for boundary vector cell firing. Analytical spherical flow is used by a template model to segment walls from the ground, to estimate self-motion and the distance and allocentric direction of walls, and to detect drop-offs. Distance estimates of walls in an empty circular or rectangular box have a mean error of less than or equal to two centimeters. Integrating these estimates into a visually driven boundary vector cell model leads to the firing patterns characteristic for boundary vector cells. This suggests that optic flow can influence the firing of boundary vector cells.},

  abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

  abstract = {Despite the predominant use of first-order methods for training deep learning models, second-order methods, and in particular, natural gradient methods, remain of interest because of their potential for accelerating training through the use of curvature information. Several methods with non-diagonal preconditioning matrices, including KFAC, Shampoo, and K-BFGS, have been proposed and shown to be effective. Based on the so-called tensor normal (TN) distribution, we propose and analyze a brand new approximate natural gradient method, Tensor Normal Training (TNT), which like Shampoo, only requires knowledge of the shape of the training parameters. By approximating the probabilistically based Fisher matrix, as opposed to the empirical Fisher matrix, our method uses the block-wise covariance of the sampling based gradient as the pre-conditioning matrix. Moreover, the assumption that the sampling-based (tensor) gradient follows a TN distribution, ensures that its covariance has a Kronecker separable structure, which leads to a tractable approximation to the Fisher matrix. Consequently, TNT's memory requirements and per-iteration computational costs are only slightly higher than those for first-order methods. In our experiments, TNT exhibited superior optimization performance to state-of-the-art first-order methods, and comparable optimization performance to the state-of-the-art second-order methods KFAC and Shampoo. Moreover, TNT demonstrated its ability to generalize as well as first-order methods, while using fewer epochs.},

  abstract = {Radiative Processes in Astrophysics: This clear, straightforward, and fundamental introduction is designed to present-from a physicist's point of view-radiation processes and their applications to astrophysical phenomena and space science. It covers such topics as radiative transfer theory, relativistic covariance and kinematics, bremsstrahlung radiation, synchrotron radiation, Compton scattering, some plasma effects, and radiative transitions in atoms. Discussion begins with first principles, physically motivating and deriving all results rather than merely presenting finished formulae. However, a reasonably good physics background (introductory quantum mechanics, intermediate electromagnetic theory, special relativity, and some statistical mechanics) is required. Much of this prerequisite material is provided by brief reviews, making the book a self-contained reference for workers in the field as well as the ideal text for senior or first-year graduate students of astronomy, astrophysics, and related physics courses. Radiative Processes in Astrophysics also contains about 75 problems, with solutions, illustrating applications of the material and methods for calculating results. This important and integral section emphasizes physical intuition by presenting important results that are used throughout the main text; it is here that most of the practical astrophysical applications become apparent.},

It is a powerful tool to investigate a variety of astrophysical processes, as well as a mean to study fundamental physics in space. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) has been selected by NASA to be the next mission dedicated to X-ray polarimetry. It is based on a Gas Pixel Detector that is able to add polarization measurement to imaging and spectroscopy, and will be placed at the focus of a conventional X-ray optics. The detector exploits the photoelectric effect in gas and a finely segmented ASIC as a collecting anode. In this work I will describe in detail the experimental technique and the detector that will fly on the IXPE mission.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density of the data, or the prior predictive) is immediately obtained by summation. It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic re-labelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

The largest improvement, when compared to naive solvers, comes from a fail-safe procedure that permits us to skip the majority of the calculations in the great majority of cases, without risking catastrophic failure in the few cases that these are actually required. Second, we identify a discriminant that enables a rational choice between Laguerre's Method and Newton's Method (or a new intermediate method) on a case-by-case basis. We briefly review the history of root solving and demonstrate that "Newton's Method" was discovered neither by Newton (1671) nor by Raphson (1690), but only by Simpson (1740). Some of the arguments leading to this conclusion were first given by the British historian of science Nick Kollerstrom in 1992, but these do not appear to have penetrated the astronomical community. Finally, we argue that Numerical Recipes should voluntarily surrender its copyright protection for non-profit applications, despite the fact that, in this particular case, such protection was the major stimulant for developing our improved algorithm.},

The repository consists of light curves generated through full likelihood analyses that model the sources and the surrounding region, providing fluxes and photon indices for each time bin. The LCR is intended as a resource for the time-domain and multi-messenger communities by allowing users to quickly search LAT data to identify correlated variability and flaring emission episodes from gamma-ray sources.

  abstract = {In many polarimetry applications, including observations in the X-ray band, the measurement of a polarization signal can be reduced to the detection and quantification of a deviation from uniformity of a distribution of measured angles of the form A + Bcos 2(ϕ – ϕ0) (0 {$<$} ϕ {$<$} π). We explore the statistics of such polarization measurements using Monte Carlo simulations and χ2 fitting methods. We compare our results to those derived using the traditional probability density used to characterize polarization measurements and quantify how they deviate as the intrinsic modulation amplitude grows. We derive relations for the number of counts required to reach a given detection level (parameterized by β the “number of σ′s” of the measurement) appropriate for measuring the modulation amplitude a by itself (single interesting parameter case) or jointly with the position angle ϕ (two interesting parameters case). We show that for the former case, when the intrinsic amplitude is equal to the well-known minimum detectable polarization, (MDP) it is, on average, detected at the 3σ level. For the latter case, when one requires a joint measurement at the same confidence level, then more counts are needed than what was required to achieve the MDP level. This additional factor is amplitude-dependent, but is ≈2.2 for intrinsic amplitudes less than about 20\%. It decreases slowly with amplitude and is ≈1.8 when the amplitude is 50\%. We find that the position angle uncertainty at 1σ confidence is well described by the relation σϕ = 28.°5/β.},

However related analysis becomes more and more difficult as the learner’s structure turns large and complex. This paper makes a preliminary step towards a new direction. We extract a local component from a large neural system, and define its relative Fisher information metric that describes accurately this small component, and is invariant to the other parts of the system. This concept is important because the geometry structure is much simplified and it can be easily applied to guide the learning of neural networks. We provide an analysis on a list of commonly used components, and demonstrate how to use this concept to further improve optimization.},

  abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) constitutes a class of computational methods rooted in Bayesian statistics. In all model-based statistical inference, the likelihood function is of central importance, since it expresses the probability of the observed data under a particular statistical model, and thus quantifies the support data lend to particular values of parameters and to choices among different models. For simple models, an analytical formula for the likelihood function can typically be derived. However, for more complex models, an analytical formula might be elusive or the likelihood function might be computationally very costly to evaluate. ABC methods bypass the evaluation of the likelihood function. In this way, ABC methods widen the realm of models for which statistical inference can be considered. ABC methods are mathematically well-founded, but they inevitably make assumptions and approximations whose impact needs to be carefully assessed. Furthermore, the wider application domain of ABC exacerbates the challenges of parameter estimation and model selection. ABC has rapidly gained popularity over the last years and in particular for the analysis of complex problems arising in biological sciences (e.g., in population genetics, ecology, epidemiology, and systems biology).},

  abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned. Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.}

  abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5\% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6\% error on the test set) and 17.3\% top-1 error on the validation set.},

  abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) require an engine capable of driving a jet of plasma to ultrarelativistic bulk Lorentz factors of up to several hundred and into narrow opening angles of a few degrees. We use global axisymmetric stationary solutions of magnetically-dominated (force-free) ultrarelativistic jets to test whether the popular magnetic-driving paradigm can generate the required Lorentz factors and opening angles. Our global solutions are obtained via time-dependent relativistic ideal magnetodynamical numerical simulations which follow the jet from the central engine to beyond six orders of magnitude in radius. Our model is primarily motivated by the collapsar model, in which a jet is produced by a spinning black hole or neutron star and then propagates through a massive stellar envelope. We find that the size of the presupernova progenitor star and the radial profile of pressure inside the star determine the terminal Lorentz factor and opening angle of the jet. At the radius where the jet breaks out of the star, our well-motivated fiducial model generates a Lorentz factor \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash sim 400\$ and a half-opening angle \$\textbackslash theta\_j\textbackslash sim 2\^\textbackslash circ\$, consistent with observations of many long-duration GRBs. Other models with slightly different parameters give \$\textbackslash gamma\$ in the range 100 to 5000 and \$\textbackslash theta\_j\$ from \$0.1\^\textbackslash circ\$ to \$10\^\textbackslash circ\$, thus reproducing the range of properties inferred for GRB jets. A potentially observable feature of some of our solutions is that the maximum Poynting flux in the jet is found at \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash sim \textbackslash theta\_j\$ with the jet power concentrated in a hollow cone, while the maximum in the Lorentz factor occurs at an angle \$\textbackslash theta\$ substantially smaller than \$\textbackslash theta\_j\$ also in a hollow cone.

COSI is a Compton telescope that covers the bandpass often referred to as the "MeV Gap" because it is the least explored region of the whole electromagnetic spectrum. COSI provides a significant improvement in sensitivity along with high-resolution spectroscopy, enabling studies of 511 keV electron-positron annihilation emission and measurements of several radioactive elements that trace the Galactic history of supernovae. COSI also measures polarization of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), accreting black holes, and pulsars as well as detecting and localizing multimessenger sources. In the following, we describe the COSI science, the instrument, and its capabilities. We highlight many Astro2020 science WPs that describe the COSI science in depth.},

  abstract = {Implicit probabilistic models are a flexible class of models defined by a simulation process for data. They form the basis for theories which encompass our understanding of the physical world. Despite this fundamental nature, the use of implicit models remains limited due to challenges in specifying complex latent structure in them, and in performing inferences in such models with large data sets. In this paper, we first introduce hierarchical implicit models (HIMs). HIMs combine the idea of implicit densities with hierarchical Bayesian modeling, thereby defining models via simulators of data with rich hidden structure. Next, we develop likelihood-free variational inference (LFVI), a scalable variational inference algorithm for HIMs. Key to LFVI is specifying a variational family that is also implicit. This matches the model's flexibility and allows for accurate approximation of the posterior. We demonstrate diverse applications: a large-scale physical simulator for predator-prey populations in ecology; a Bayesian generative adversarial network for discrete data; and a deep implicit model for text generation.},

  abstract = {Newly formed black holes of stellar mass launch collimated outflows (jets) of ionized matter that approach the speed of light. These outflows power prompt, brief and intense flashes of γ-rays known as γ-ray bursts (GRBs), followed by longer-lived afterglow radiation that is detected across the electromagnetic spectrum. Measuring the polarization of the observed GRB radiation provides a direct probe of the magnetic fields in the collimated jets. Rapid-response polarimetric observations of newly discovered bursts have probed the initial afterglow phase, and show that, minutes after the prompt emission has ended, the degree of linear polarization can be as high as 30 per cent-consistent with the idea that a stable, globally ordered magnetic field permeates the jet at large distances from the central source. By contrast, optical and γ-ray observations during the prompt phase have led to discordant and often controversial results, and no definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the origin of the prompt radiation or the configuration of the magnetic field. Here we report the detection of substantial (8.3\,±\,0.8 per cent from our most conservative simulation), variable linear polarization of a prompt optical flash that accompanied the extremely energetic and long-lived prompt γ-ray emission from GRB 160625B. Our measurements probe the structure of the magnetic field at an early stage of the jet, closer to its central black hole, and show that the prompt phase is produced via fast-cooling synchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field that is advected from the black hole and distorted by dissipation processes within the jet.},

  abstract = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

  abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscured by optically thick circumnuclear matter and in radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anisotropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which include radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and properties of AGN and summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking quasars and luminous radio galaxies and another linking BL\textasciitilde Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies. Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {There has been enormous progress in the last few years in designing neural networks that respect the fundamental symmetries and coordinate freedoms of physical law. Some of these frameworks make use of irreducible representations, some make use of high-order tensor objects, and some apply symmetry-enforcing constraints. Different physical laws obey different combinations of fundamental symmetries, but a large fraction (possibly all) of classical physics is equivariant to translation, rotation, reflection (parity), boost (relativity), and permutations. Here we show that it is simple to parameterize universally approximating polynomial functions that are equivariant under these symmetries, or under the Euclidean, Lorentz, and Poincar\textbackslash 'e groups, at any dimensionality \$d\$. The key observation is that nonlinear O(\$d\$)-equivariant (and related-group-equivariant) functions can be universally expressed in terms of a lightweight collection of scalars -- scalar products and scalar contractions of the scalar, vector, and tensor inputs. We complement our theory with numerical examples that show that the scalar-based method is simple, efficient, and scalable.},

  abstract = {Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the rapid variations of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714 in the radio, optical, ultraviolet, and x-ray regimes. Several simultaneous multifrequency campaigns have been carried out. Here we describe the complete analysis of a four-week monitoring campaign at three radio and three optical frequency bands, simultaneous optical-UV and optical-x-ray observations, and the correlations between rapid variations and changes on longer time scales. We also investigate the polarization properties in the radio regime. The major observational results are the high duty cycle of variability in all frequency bands and correlations between the rapid variations in different frequency regimes. The source is almost always variable. Most power resides on time scales of a few days. These rapid variations are closely related over a wide range in frequencies. A close correlation is observed through the optical-radio regime. The simultaneous optical/x-ray investigations are consistent with a close correlation, but the sampling is too poor to determine a transfer function. While no spectral changes have been found in the optical regime, the radio spectral index varies in a similar way as the flux densities do in the radio regime. We find a close correlation with zero lag between the spectral index between 5 and 8.4 GHz, and the optical flux density, indicating that the source gets optically thick in the low-frequency part of the synchrotron branch during states of high optical flux. We interpret the close correlations between the variations in the optical and the radio regime as an indication that the rapid radio variability is not caused by interstellar scintillation. Various arguments rule out gravitational microlensing. Intrinsic intraday radio variability requires enormous brightness temperatures and calls for extremely high boosting factors to avoid the Compton catastrophe, if the radiation is due to incoherent synchrotron emission. We discuss the implications of our observations for various models which aim at explaining rapid variation of nonthermal radiation by either disk or jet models.},

  abstract = {This work presents an end-to-end trainable deep bidirectional LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) model for image captioning. Our model builds on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and two separate LSTM networks. It is capable of learning long term visual-language interactions by making use of history and future context information at high level semantic space. Two novel deep bidirectional variant models, in which we increase the depth of nonlinearity transition in different way, are proposed to learn hierarchical visual-language embeddings. Data augmentation techniques such as multi-crop, multi-scale and vertical mirror are proposed to prevent overfitting in training deep models. We visualize the evolution of bidirectional LSTM internal states over time and qualitatively analyze how our models "translate" image to sentence. Our proposed models are evaluated on caption generation and image-sentence retrieval tasks with three benchmark datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We demonstrate that bidirectional LSTM models achieve highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art results on caption generation even without integrating additional mechanism (e.g. object detection, attention model etc.) and significantly outperform recent methods on retrieval task.},

  abstract = {The prospects for accomplishing X-ray polarization measurements appear to have grown in recent years after a more than 35-year hiatus. Unfortunately, this long hiatus has brought with it some confusion over the statistical uncertainties associated with polarization measurements of astronomical sources. The heart of this confusion stems from a misunderstanding (or potential misunderstanding) of a standard figure of merit-the minimum detectable polarization (MDP)-that one of us introduced many years ago. We review the relevant statistics, and quantify the differences between the MDP and the uncertainty of an actual polarization measurement. We discuss the implications for future missions.},

  abstract = {We report the results of a multifrequency campaign targeting S5~0716+714 in the flaring state of the source observed in 2015 January and February. The observations have been performed using the following instruments: Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT), Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, X-ray Telescope and Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope. The elevated flux level was visible in all frequencies and the outburst consists of five sub-flares. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of the X-ray observations both in the soft and hard regimes for data collected with NuSTAR and Swift/XRT. This is the first time, when hard X-ray observations of the source collected with NuSTAR are reported. The studies reveal both low- and high-energy components clearly visible in the energy band, with the break energy of 8~keV, which is the highest break energy ever reported for S5~0716+714. The second part of this work is concentrated on multifrequency observations collected during the flaring activity period. The variability patterns recorded during the period are characterized using a fractional variability amplitude and description of the flare profiles. The correlation studies reveal strong and significant relation between the optical, ultraviolet and γ-ray observations, and no time lag is found for any of the studied relations.},

  abstract = {The total magnification in gravitational microlensing by star(s) is known to have a lower bound of one. However, when the source is inside the caustics, the total magnification must be larger because of the extra pair(s) of images created. In this Letter, we develop a new formalism for studying the magnifications for lensing by double lenses. We prove analytically that when a source is inside the caustics, the sum of five image magnifications times their corresponding parities is one and the minimum total magnification is three. For a source located on the binary axis, the total magnification can be obtained analytically without directly solving the lens equation. For multiple (number ≥ 3) stars, the minimum total magnification extends below three. We give an explanation why this is so. Any caustic crossing event found in the ongoing microlensing experiments that has a minimum magnification smaller than three between the caustic peaks requires either an unlensed component superposed along the line of sight or a multiple star configuration. These two possibilities can be differentiated by multiband observations.},

This model is based on a neural structure called a sinusoidal array, which allows an efficient representation of vector information with neurons. We show that exact path integration can easily be achieved by a neural network. Thus deviations from the direct home trajectory, found previously in experiments with ants, can not be explained by computational limitations of the nervous system. Instead we suggest that the observed deviations are caused by a strategy to simplify landmark navigation.},

In addition to investigating fundamental physics, eXTP will be a very powerful observatory for astrophysics that will provide observations of unprecedented quality on a variety of galactic and extragalactic objects. In particular, its wide field monitoring capabilities will be highly instrumental to detect the electro-magnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources. The paper provides a detailed description of: (1) the technological and technical aspects, and the expected performance of the instruments of the scientific payload; (2) the elements and functions of the mission, from the spacecraft to the ground segment.},

  abstract = {eXTP is a science mission designed to study the state of matter under extreme conditions of density, gravity and magnetism. Primary goals are the determination of the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear density, the measurement of QED effects in highly magnetized star, and the study of accretion in the strong-field regime of gravity. Primary targets include isolated and binary neutron stars, strong magnetic field systems like magnetars, and stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. The mission carries a unique and unprecedented suite of state-of-the-art scientific instruments enabling for the first time ever the simultaneous spectral-timing-polarimetry studies of cosmic sources in the energy range from 0.5-30 keV (and beyond). Key elements of the payload are: the Spectroscopic Focusing Array (SFA) - a set of 11 X-ray optics for a total effective area of ∼0.9 m\textsuperscript{2} and 0.6 m\textsuperscript{2} at 2 keV and 6 keV respectively, equipped with Silicon Drift Detectors offering \&lt;180 eV spectral resolution; the Large Area Detector (LAD) - a deployable set of 640 Silicon Drift Detectors, for a total effective area of ∼3.4 m\textsuperscript{2}, between 6 and 10 keV, and spectral resolution better than 250 eV; the Polarimetry Focusing Array (PFA) – a set of 2 X-ray telescope, for a total effective area of 250 cm\textsuperscript{2} at 2 keV, equipped with imaging gas pixel photoelectric polarimeters; the Wide Field Monitor (WFM) - a set of 3 coded mask wide field units, equipped with position-sensitive Silicon Drift Detectors, each covering a 90 degrees x 90 degrees field of view. The eXTP international consortium includes major institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Universities in China, as well as major institutions in several European countries and the United States. The predecessor of eXTP, the XTP mission concept, has been selected and funded as one of the so-called background missions in the Strategic Priority Space Science Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences since 2011. The strong European participation has significantly enhanced the scientific capabilities of eXTP. The planned launch date of the mission is earlier than 2025.},

  abstract = {Magnetic reconnection is invoked as one of the primary mechanisms to produce energetic particles. We employ large-scale three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in magnetically-dominated (\$\textbackslash sigma=10\$) pair plasmas to study the energization physics of high-energy particles. We identify a novel acceleration mechanism that only operates in 3D. For weak guide fields, 3D plasmoids / flux ropes extend along the \$z\$ direction of the electric current for a length comparable to their cross-sectional radius. Unlike in 2D simulations, where particles are buried in plasmoids, in 3D we find that a fraction of particles with \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash gtrsim 3\textbackslash sigma\$ can escape from plasmoids by moving along \$z\$, and so they can experience the large-scale fields in the upstream region. These "free" particles preferentially move in \$z\$ along Speiser-like orbits sampling both sides of the layer, and are accelerated linearly in time -- their Lorentz factor scales as \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash propto t\$, in contrast to \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash propto \textbackslash sqrt\{t\}\$ in 2D. The energy gain rate approaches \$\textbackslash sim eE\_\{\textbackslash rm rec\}c\$, where \$E\_\{\textbackslash rm rec\}\textbackslash simeq 0.1 B\_0\$ is the reconnection electric field and \$B\_0\$ the upstream magnetic field. The spectrum of free particles is hard, \$dN\_\{\textbackslash rm free\}/d\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash propto \textbackslash gamma\^\{-1.5\}\$, contains \$\textbackslash sim 20\textbackslash\%\$ of the dissipated magnetic energy independently of domain size, and extends up to a cutoff energy scaling linearly with box size. Our results demonstrate that relativistic reconnection in GRB and AGN jets may be a promising mechanism for generating ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.},

  abstract = {Relativistic magnetic reconnection events can widely exist in magnetized plasmas in astrophysical systems. During this process, oppositely directed magnetic field lines reconnect and release magnetic energy, efficiently accelerating nonthermal particles. However, so far there is little clear observational signatures of relativistic magnetic reconnection events in astrophysical systems. Blazars are relativistic magnetized plasma outflows from supermassive black holes. Their multi-wavelength flares may be powered by relativistic magnetic reconnection. The highly variable radiation and polarization signatures are well covered by multi-wavelength observation campaigns, making them ideal targets to examine the magnetic reconnection model. Recent observations have found that several blazar flares are accompanied by optical polarization angle swings which may be of as large amplitude as \${$>$} 180\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$, challenging existing theoretical models. In this paper, we present integrated particle-in-cell (PIC) and polarized radiation transfer simulations of magnetic reconnection events. We find that plasmoid coalescences in the reconnection layer can give rise to highly variable light curves, low and fluctuating polarization degree, and rotating polarization angle. In particular, large-amplitude polarization angle swings, similar to those observed during blazar flares, can be a unique signature of relativistic magnetic reconnection events.},

In addition to small fluctuations of the polarization angle around a mean value, large (≳180°) polarization angle swings are sometimes observed. We suggest that such phenomena can be interpreted as arising from light travel time effects within an underlying axisymmetric emission region. We present the first simultaneous fitting of the multi-wavelength spectrum, variability, and time-dependent polarization features of a correlated optical and gamma-ray flaring event of the prominent blazar 3C279, which was accompanied by a drastic change in its polarization signatures. This unprecedented combination of spectral, variability, and polarization information in a coherent physical model allows us to place stringent constraints on the particle acceleration and magnetic field topology in the relativistic jet of a blazar, strongly favoring a scenario in which magnetic energy dissipation is the primary driver of the flare event.},

  abstract = {The optical radiation and polarization signatures in blazars are known  to be highly variable during flaring activities. It is frequently argued that shocks are the main driver of the flaring events. However, the spectral variability modelings generally lack detailed considerations of the self-consistent magnetic field evolution modeling; thus, so far the associated optical polarization signatures are poorly understood. We present the first simultaneous modeling of the optical radiation and polarization signatures based on 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic shocks in the blazar emission environment, with the simplest physical assumptions. By comparing the results with observations, we find that shocks in a weakly magnetized environment will largely lead to significant changes in the optical polarization signatures, which are seldom seen in observations. Hence an emission region with relatively strong magnetization is preferred. In such an environment, slow shocks may produce minor flares with either erratic polarization fluctuations or considerable polarization variations, depending on the parameters; fast shocks can produce major flares with smooth polarization angle rotations. In addition, the magnetic fields in both cases are observed to actively revert to the original topology after the shocks. All these features are consistent with observations. Future observations of the radiation and polarization signatures will further constrain the flaring mechanism and the blazar emission environment.},

  abstract = {The characteristic two-component blazar spectral energy distribution (SED) can be of either leptonic and/or hadronic origins. The potential association of the high-energy neutrino event IceCube-170922A with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056 indicates that hadronic processes may operate in a blazar jet. Despite multiwavelength follow-ups of the event and extensive theoretical modelings, the radiation mechanisms and the underlying magnetic field strength and configuration remain poorly understood. In this paper, we consider generic leptonic and hadronic blazar spectral models with distinct magnetic field strengths and radiation mechanisms. We analytically reproduce the SEDs and neutrino flux of hadronic models, and predict their X-ray to γ-ray polarization degrees. Furthermore, by performing relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations taking into account the polarization-dependent radiation transfer, we study the time-dependent multiwavelength polarization variability of the proton synchrotron (PS) model under a shock scenario. Our results suggest that the high-energy polarization degree and the neutrino flux can be jointly used to pinpoint the leptonic and/or hadronic blazar radiation mechanisms in the X-ray and γ-ray bands, and to infer the magnetic field strength in the emission region. In addition, the temporal multiwavelength polarization signatures in the PS shed light on the jet energy composition and the dynamical importance of magnetic fields in the blazar emission region. Future multiwavelength polarimetry facilities such as the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer and All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory together with neutrino telescopes such as IceCube can provide unprecedented observational constraints to probe the blazar radiation mechanisms and jet dynamics.},

  abstract = {Blazars are relativistic magnetized plasma outflows from supermassive black holes that point very close to our line of sight. Their emission is nonthermal dominated and highly variable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as the driver of particle acceleration during blazar flares. While recent particle-in-cell simulations have self-consistently studied the evolution of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration therein, the resulting radiation signatures have not been systematically explored. In particular, the polarization signatures, which directly reflect the characteristic strongly dynamical magnetic field evolution during reconnection, have not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we present a systematic study of radiation and polarization signatures arising from magnetic reconnection in blazars, based on combined PIC and polarized radiation transfer simulations with various physical parameters. We identify a harder-when-brighter trend in the spectral evolution. Moreover, higher-frequency bands tend to flare earlier than lower-frequency bands in the synchrotron spectral component. Most importantly, polarization signatures appear more variable with higher frequencies. We find that the temporal polarization variations strongly depends on the guide field strength. Specifically, reconnection with significant guide field component leads to very high polarization degree that contradict to typical blazar observations, while large polarization angle rotations are unique signatures of magnetic reconnection between nearly anti-parallel magnetic field lines. These rotations are at least \$90\^o\$ and can extend to \${$>$}180\^o\$, and they may rotate in both directions. These results imply that blazars that have shown large polarization angle rotations intrinsically have more nearly anti-parallel magnetic field morphology.},

In this paper, we give a survey for MTL from the perspective of algorithmic modeling, applications and theoretical analyses. For algorithmic modeling, we give a definition of MTL and then classify different MTL algorithms into five categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach and decomposition approach as well as discussing the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, we review online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works in this paper. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for MTL.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of time- and energy-dependent synchrotron polarization signatures in a shock-in-jet model for γ-ray blazars. Our calculations employ a full three-dimensional radiation transfer code, assuming a helical magnetic field throughout the jet. The code considers synchrotron emission from an ordered magnetic field, and takes into account all light-travel-time and other relevant geometric effects, while the relevant synchrotron self-Compton and external Compton effects are handled with the two-dimensional Monte-Carlo/Fokker-Planck (MCFP) code. We consider several possible mechanisms through which a relativistic shock propagating through the jet may affect the jet plasma to produce a synchrotron and high-energy flare. Most plausibly, the shock is expected to lead to a compression of the magnetic field, increasing the toroidal field component and thereby changing the direction of the magnetic field in the region affected by the shock. We find that such a scenario leads to correlated synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton flaring, associated with substantial variability in the synchrotron polarization percentage and position angle. Most importantly, this scenario naturally explains large polarization angle rotations by {$>\sptilde$} 180°, as observed in connection with γ-ray flares in several blazars, without the need for bent or helical jet trajectories or other nonaxisymmetric jet features.},
