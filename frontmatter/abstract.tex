    Measuring X-ray polarization has been a major goal in astrophysics for the last 40 years. X-ray polarization measurements offer rich opportunities to probe the magnetic field topology and emission physics of high energy astrophysical sources, such as accreting black holes and astrophysical jets \citep{krawczynski_using_2019, weisskopf_overview_2018}. 
    The recent development of photoelectron tracking detectors \citep{bellazzini_novel_2003} has greatly improved the prospects of doing so. The gas pixel detector (GPD) \citep{bellazzini_sealed_2007} has brought soft X-ray polarimetry (1-10 keV) to the PolarLight CubeSat test \citep{feng_x-ray_2020}, the scheduled NASA IXPE mission \citep{sgro_imaging_2019}, and the potential Chinese mission, eXTP \citep{zhang_extp_2017}.
