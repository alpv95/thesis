## Abstract

Measuring X-ray polarization has been a major goal in astrophysics for the last 40 years. With the launch of NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in December 2021, soft X-ray polarimetry (1-10 keV) is now possible. In this thesis, I introduce an optimal signal extraction method for X-ray polarimeters based on gas pixel detectors. Using IXPE's thus improved sensitivity, I make progress towards identifying the high-energy emission processes and magnetic field geometries responsible for radiation in blazar jets. First, I develop a simulation-based inference framework for measuring X-ray polarization as a function of time, energy, and position in gas pixel detectors, proving that for a fixed model budget the framework is optimal. Second, I propose a simple geometrical jet model to study the polarization properties of leptonic blazar jets, including their observed EVPA rotations and their detection prospects with IXPE. Finally, I interpret IXPE's measurements of BL Lacertae across the synchro-Compton transition region to suggest leptonic-dominated emission processes in blazars, and of Mrk 421 to provide evidence for helical magnetic fields as the source of EVPA rotations.
